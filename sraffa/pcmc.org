* Part I. Single-Product Industries and Circulating Capital
** Ch. 1. Production for Subsistence
*** 1. Two Commodities 
#+NAME: section_1
# <<section_1>>
- We consider an economy with two commodities, producing just enough to
   maintain itself.
- Commodities are produced by separate industries and
  are exchanged at a market held after the harvest.
- Wheat an iron are produced, representing sustenance for the
  workers and the means of production (respectively). 
- We suppose that 280 quarters of wheat and 12 tons of iron are used
  to produce 400 quarters of wheat, whereas 120 quarters of wheat
  and 8 tons of iron are used to produce 20 tons of iron. We
  represent a year's operations as: \\

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
   280 qr. wheat + 12 t. iron \to 400 qr. wheat
   120 qr. wheat +  8 t. iron \to 20  t. iron.
  #+END_VERSE 

 - Note that when we add up the columns, it's *equal* to the
   output. This is what we mean when we say "There is no surplus."
 - These relations Sraffa calls "the methods of production and
   productive consumption" or *the methods of production*.
*** 2. Three or More
#+NAME: section_2
- The same applies to any number of commodities. For example, if we add
  a third sector (pigs): \\
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
240 qr. wheat + 12 t. iron + 18 pigs \to 450 qr. wheat
90  qr. wheat +  6 t. iron + 12 pigs \to 21 t. iron
120 qr. wheat +  3 t. iron + 30 pigs \to 60 pigs
  #+END_VERSE
- The exchange values which ensure replacement all around are 10 qr
  wheat = 1 t iron = 2 pigs.
- The general procedure for calculating this is to "normalize the
  output", in the sense of dividing each qr of wheat by 450, dividing
  each t of iron by 21, and dividing each pig by 60, (more generally,
  divide each widget by the quantity of widgets produced), so we consider
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
(8/15) qr. wheat + (4/7) t. iron + (3/10) pigs \to 1 qr. wheat
(3/15) qr. wheat + (2/7) t. iron + (2/10) pigs \to 1 t. iron
(4/15) qr. wheat + (1/7) t. iron + (5/10) pigs \to 1 pig
  #+END_VERSE
- Then we just use linear algebra to solve this as usual.
*** 3. General Case
#+NAME: section_3
- We have commodities of different "species" (e.g., iron, wheat,
  etc.). Lower case variables will keep track of each species /a/, /b/,
  /c/, ..., /k/. NB: the term "species" is mine, not Sraffa's.
  - *Caution:* Sraffa abuses notation and mixes up /A/ and /a/ when
    referring to the species.
  - *Abuse of Notation:* We will write /k/ to indicate the number of
    sectors, as well as its proper meaning. It will depend on the
    context, but it should be clear when used.
- We denote /A/ the quantity annually produced of /a/, /B/ the quantity
  annually produced of /b/, etc.
- We will call /A_a/, /B_a/, ..., /K_a/ the quantities of /a/, /b/, ...,
  /k/ annually used in the industry producing /a/, and so on.
- The prices are the unknowns /p_a/, /p_b/, ..., /p_k/, which represent
  the values of 1 unit of the commodities /a/, /b/, ..., /k/
  (respectively) necessary to restore the initial position.
- We can now cast the conditions of production as: \\
  #+begin_verse
  /A_{a}p_a/ + /B_{a}p_b/ + ... + /K_{a}p_k/ = /Ap_a/
  /A_{b}p_a/ + /B_{b}p_b/ + ... + /K_{b}p_k/ = /Bp_b/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  /A_{k}p_a/ + /B_{k}p_b/ + ... + /K_{k}p_k/ = /Kp_k/
  #+end_verse
- Note that we assume the system to be in a self-replacing state, so
  /A_a/ + /A_b/ + ... + /A_k/ = /A/, /B_a/ + /B_b/ + ... + /B_k/ = /B/,
  and so on. That is to say, the sum of the first column equals the
  output of the first row, etc.
  - Again, the approach one should take is to work with modified
    quantities /A'_{a}/ = /A_{a}/ รท /A/ and so on, working with primed
    quantities as inputs and output quantitiess (*NOT PRICES*) set to 1. 
- It is un-necessary to assume every commodity enters /directly/ into
  the production of every other. We could have pigs enter into
  production of wheat but not iron, and no iron enter into the
  production of pigs.
- One commodity is taken as the standard measure of value, and its price
  is set to 1. This leaves /k/ - 1 unknowns. It doesn't really matter
  which commodity we pick, since the relative exchange-value doesn't
  change. This leaves /k/ - 1 independent linear equations which
  uniquely determine the /k/ - 1 prices. (This is similar to Marx's
  "general form of value" discussed in [[http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S3c][/Das Kapital/, Vol. 1, Ch. 1]].)
- *Puzzle.* Consider the situation when the determinant of the
  production matrix is zero, which would happen if there are two rows or columns
  which differ by a constant multiple. What would this correspond to
  economically (i.e., how would we interpret this)? And how would we
  solve it? Could it ever happen "in reality"?
** Ch. 2. Production with a Surplus
*** 4. The rate of Profits
#+NAME: section_4
- If the economy produces more than the bare minimum necessary
  for replacement, i.e., we have some surplus to be distributed,
  then our model becomes self-contradictory. Why? Because the
  "Gross National Product" (the right hand side) will contain the
  sum of the columns on the left hand side plus bonus parts. We
  cannot use the basic linear algebra one might naively use.
- We alot the surplus /simultaneously/ as when the prices are
  determined. 
  - We cannot alot the surplus /before/ the prices are
    determined. The surplus must be distributed in proportion to
    the means of production advanced in each industry. 
    Such a proportion between two aggregates of heterogeneous
    goods ("the rate of profits") cannot be determined before we
    know the prices of goods.
  - OTOH, we cannot defer the allotment of the surplus till after
    the prices are known, since the prices cannot be determined
    before knowing the rate of profits.
  - The distribution of the suplus *must* be determined through
    the same mechanism and at the same time as the prices of
    commodities. 
- We add the rate of profits ("which must be uniform for all
  industries") as an unknown, /r/, and the system becomes
  #+begin_verse  
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) = /Ap_{a}/
  (/A_{b}p_{a}/ + /B_{b}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) = /Bp_{b}/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
  (/A_{k}p_{a}/ + /B_{k}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) = /Kp_{k}/  
  #+end_verse
  where, since we have a self-replacing state, we need /A_{a}/ +
  /A_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}/ \le /A/, /B_{a}/ + /B_{b}/ + ... +
  /B_{k}/ \le /B/, and so on. In other words: the quantity
  produced of each commodity is /at least/ equal to the quantity
  of it used in other sectors' production together.
- The system has /k/ independent equations, which determines the
  /k - 1/ unknowns plus the rate of profit.
*** 5. Example of Rate of Profits
#+NAME: section_5
- Lets revise our example from \sect[[section_1][1]] to have a surplus:
  #+begin_verse
  280 qr wheat + 12 t iron \to 575 qr. wheat
  120 qr wheat +  8 t iron \to  20  t. iron
  #+end_verse
  The answer is 15 qr wheat = 1 t. iron will restore the initial
  condition, and the rate of profit is /r/ = 25%
  - The trick is to rewrite this as producing one unit output in
    each sector:
    #+begin_verse
    (56/115) qr wheat + 3/5 t iron \to 1 qr. wheat
    (24/115) qr wheat + 2/5 t iron \to 1 t. iron
    #+end_verse
    Then we let /p_{w}/ be the price of 1 qr wheat, /p_{i}/ be
    the price of 1 t iron, /r/ the rate of profits.
  - We have an eigen-problem of the form: /A/ *x* = /\lambda/ *x*   
    where /\lambda = 1/(1+r)/, /A/ is the matrix we deduced, and
    *x*  is the vector (/p_{w}/, /p_{i}/). 
  - Note that the matrix has eigenvalues /\lambda/ = 4/5, 2/23.
  - The rate of profit /r/ = /\lambda^{-1}/-1 could be either 1/4
    or 23/2. Since the rate of profit must satisfy 0\le /r/\le 1,
    we see /r/ = 1/4 is the solution.
  - Now that we have our solution for /r/, we plug it into one of
    the sectors at random and solve for the prices. Since 1 + /r/
    = 5/4, we see:
    #+begin_verse
    (280 /p_{w}/ + 12 /p_{i}/)(5/4) = 575 /p_{w}/
    #+end_verse
    implies 15 /p_{i}/ = 225 /p_{w}/, or equivalently 1 t iron
    may be traded for 15 qr wheat.
  - *Question:* What if we plugged in /r/ = 23/2 instead?
    - We then find (280 /p_{w}/ + 12 /p_{i}/)(25/2) = 575 /p_{w}/ or
      equivalently, 39 /p_{w}/ = -2 /p_{i}/...which is hard to explain
      as a coherent choice for prices.
*** 6. Basic and Non-Basic Products
#+NAME: section_6
- Notice before, without surplus, all commodities produced /must/
  be used in the production of other commodities. But now, with
  surplus, we may have commodities which are not needed in the
  production process. These commodities are called *luxury* goods.
  - You should really convince yourself this must be the case,
    since we affirmed before the sum of the columns for the
    production matrix must be equal to the output. That is to
    say: the total inputs must be equal to the total
    outputs. Otherwise, by definition, there is surplus.
- Notice also the luxury goods do not affect the rate of profits.
- If the production of a given luxury good doubled with constant inputs,
  the price per unit of given luxury good would /halve/. The
  price relations of all other goods would remain the same,
  however. 
- The price of a luxury good is *not* an unknown we are trying to
  solve for, yet the prices of non-luxury goods *are* unknowns
  which we need to determine. With the non-luxury good prices
  determined, we may deduce the luxury goods prices.
- *Definition.* The certeria is: does a ccommodity enter (either directly or
  indirectly) the production of /all/ commodities. Those that do,
  we shall call *basic* and those which do not are *non-basic*
  commodities. 
*** 7. Terminological Note
#+NAME: section_7
- Why do we call the ratios satisfying conditions of production "values"
  or "prices" rather than "costs of production"?
- The latter would be adequate so far as *non*-basic products were
  concerned, since their exchange ratio is merely a reflection of what
  must be paid for their means of production, labour, and profits in
  order to produce---there is no mutual dependence.
- Basic products have another dimension
  - Its exchange-ratio depends on its use in the production of other
    basic commodities, as much as on the extent to which those
    commodities enter its own production.
  - One might be tempted to say "it depends as much on the Demand side
    as on the Supply side", but one would be *wrong*
- The price of non-basic products depends on the prices of its means of
  production, but these (the prices of its means of production) do not depend on it
- A basic product has the prices of its means of production depend on
  its own price no less than the latter depends on them
- Sraffa argues a "less one-sided description than cost of production
  seems therefore required".
  - Classical terms include:
    1. "necessary price" 
       - generically, the physiocrats used this term,
       - Pierre Paul Mercier de la Riviรจre, /The Natural and Essential Order of Political Societies/ "The necessary price of a piece of work
         consists of the disbursements made by the worker for the
         purchase of primary materials, and of the sum total of all his
         consumption during the work."
       - Thomas Hodgskin's
         [[http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Hodgskin/hgskPP10.html#IX.1][Popular Political Economy, IX.1]] "...the natural and necessary
         price of money being determined...by the quantity of labour
         required to produce it"
    2. "natural price" 
       - Adam Smith's /Inquiry/
         [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book01/ch04.htm][Ch. 4]], [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book01/ch07.htm][Ch. 7]] "The natural price...is...the prices of all
         commodities are continually gravitating"; 
       - David Ricardo's [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/ricardo/tax/ch04.htm][/Principles/ Ch. 5]];
       - J.S. Mill's [[http://www.econlib.org/library/Mill/mlP32.html#III.3.4][/Principles/ III.4]] "value...proportional to its cost
         of production, [is] its Natural Value (or its Natural Price)"; 
       - NB: John Locke appears to be the first(?) English economist to
         use the terms "natural price" and "market price" in [[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/locke/part1.htm][/Some Considerations of the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising the Value of Money/]]),
    3. "price of production" (e.g., Marx?)
  - But value and price have been preferred, because (a) it's shorter;
    and (b) in the present context --- which has no reference to "market
    prices" --- it's no more ambiguous.
- In general Sraffa avoids the term "cost of production", as well as the
  term "capital" (in its quantitative connotation), even at the expense
  of tiresome circumlocution
  - These terms have become inseparably linked with the supposition they
    stand for quantities which can be measured independently of --- and
    prior to --- the determination of the prices of the products.
  - Consider the "real costs" of Marshall ("But now we have to take account of the fact that the
    production of a commodity generally requires many different kinds of
    labour and the use of capital in many forms. The exertions of all
    the different kinds of labour that are directly or indirectly
    involved in making it; together with the abstinences or rather the
    waitings required for saving the capital used in making it: all
    these efforts and sacrifices together will be called the real cost
    of production of the commodity." Alfred Marshall's 
    [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/marshall/bk5ch03.htm][Principles of Economics, Book 5, Chapter 3]]) 
    and the "quantity of capital" which is implied in the marginal
    productivity theory. 
  - Sraffa avoids suppositions which such terms connotate, since he's
    trying to critique the marginalist paradigm.
*** 8. Subsistence-Wage and Surplus-Wage
#+NAME: section_8
- We have regarded wages as consisting of the necessary subsistence of
  the workers, and enters the system on equal footing as fuel for
  engines or feed for cattle.
- Sraffa takes into account the "other aspect of wages" since, besides
  the ever-present element of subsistence, they may include a share of
  the "surplus product".
- We separate the wages into two components: one is the subsistence,
  which we keep as inputs on equal footing as fuel or feed; the other is
  the "division of the surplus", which we /should/ as variable. 
  - Working with tradition, we will refrain from parting with tradition,
    and shall follow the usual practice treating the whole wage as
    variable.
- Drawback: This approach relegates the necessaries of consumption to
  the "limbo" of non-basic products. 
  - This is because the necessaries of consumption no longer appear
    alongside the other means of production, i.e., they don't appear on
    the left hand side of the equations.
  - An improvement in the methods of production for necessaries of life
    will no longer directly affect rates of profits and the prices of
    other products.
  - Necessaries are essentially basic, and if they are prevented from
    exerting influence on prices and profits under that label, they do
    so in devious ways (Sraffa suggests, e.g., "by setting a limit below
    which the wage cannot fall", a limit which would itself fall with
    any improvement in the methods of production for necessaries,
    "carrying with it a rise in the rates of profits and a change in the
    prices of other products".)
- The discussion Sraffa entertains can "easily be adapted to the more
  appropriate, if unconventional, interpretation of the wage suggested
  above". 
*** 9. Wages paid out of the product
#+NAME: section_9
- *Assumption (Wage paid after production).* We shall hereafter *assume*
  the wage is paid /post factum/ as a share of the annual product. Thus
  we *abandon* the classical economists' idea of a wage "advanced" from capital.
- We retain the supposition of an annual cycle of production with an
  annual market.
*** 10. Quantity and Quality of Labor
#+NAME: section_10
- The quantity of labor employed in each industry should now be
  represented explicitly, taking the place of the corresponding
  quantities of subsistence.
- We suppose labor to be uniform in quality or (what amounts to the same
  thing) we assume any difference in quality to have been previously
  reduced to equivalent differences in quantity, so each unit of labor
  receives the same wage.
- We call /L_{a}/, /L_{b}/, ..., /L_{k}/ the annual quantities of labor
  respectively employed in the industries producing /a/, /b/, ..., /k/
  and we define them as fractions of the total annual labor of society,
  which we take as unity. So: \\
  #+begin_verse
  /L_{a}/ + /L_{b}/ + ... + /L_{k}/ = 1
  #+end_verse
  - *Remark.* It seems labor is treated differently than other
    commodities. For example, it doesn't have its own "sector"
    (equation). And it's already normalized!
- We call /w/ the wage per unit of labor, which like the prices will be
  expressed in terms of the chosen standard
  - (See also, on the choice of a standard, in \sect[[section_12][12]])
*** 11. Equations of Production
#+NAME: section_11
- So, with these additional assumptions, the equations take the form:
  #+begin_verse
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{a}w/ = /Ap_{a}/
  (/A_{b}p_{a}/ + /B_{b}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{b}w/ = /Bp_{b}/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  (/A_{k}p_{a}/ + /B_{k}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{k}w/ = /Kp_{k}/
  #+end_verse
- We assume, as before, the system is in a self-replacing state, so
  /A_{a}+A_{b}+...+A_{k}\le A/, /B_{a}/ + /B_{b}/ + ... + /B_{k}/ \le
  /B/, etc.
*** 12. National Income in a Self-Replacing System
#+NAME: section_12
- *Definition.* The *National Income* of a system in a self-replacing
  state consists of the set of commodities which are "left over" after
  the articles replacing the means of production are used up.
  - In other words, if we denote /\Delta A/ = /A/ - (/A_{a}/ + /A_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}/)
    and so on for all other industries, we have /(\Delta A)p_{a}/ + /(\Delta
    B)p_{b}/ + ... + /(\Delta K)p_{k}/ be the national income.
- *Convention (Value of National Income Set to Unity).*
  The value of this set of commodities, or "composite commodities" as it
  may be called, which forms the national income...we set to 1.
  - Thus the national income becomes the standard in terms of which the
    wage and /k/ prices are expressed (taking the place of the arbitrarily
    chosen single commodity in terms of which the /k/ - 1 prices, besides
    the wage, were expressed).
  - We have the additional equation:
    #+begin_verse
    (/\Delta A/) /p_{a}/ + (/\Delta B/) /p_{b}/ + ... + (/\Delta K/) /p_{k}/ = 1.
    #+end_verse
  - It is impossible for the aggregate quantity of any commodity
    represented in this expression to be negative, otherwise we contradict
    the assumption the economy is in a self-replacing state!
  - This gives /k/ + 1 equations as compared to /k/ + 2 variables (the /k/
    prices, the wage /w/, and the rate of profits /r/).
  - The result of adding the wage as one of the variables is that the
    number of these now exceeds the number of equations by one. The system
    has "one degree of freedom". If one of the variables is fixed, the
    others will be too.
** Ch. 3. Proportions of Labour to Means of Production
 *CAUTION:* This entire section appears to be completely abstract
reasoning, without manipulating a model at hand. Proceed /very slowly!/
*** 13. Wages as a Proportion of National Income
#+NAME: section_13
- We now give the wage /w/ successive values ranging from 1 to 0: these
  represent fractions of the national income
  (compare \sect[[section_10][10]] and \sect[[section_12][12]]).
- The object: observe the effect of changes in the wage on rate of
  profits, and on the prices of individual commodities...on the
  assumption the methods of production remain unchanged.
*** 14. Values when whole National Income goes to Wages
#+NAME: section_14
- When we make /w/ equal to 1, the whole national income goes to wages
  and /r/ is eliminated.
- We thus revert to the systems of equations we /began/ with! The
  difference being the quantities of labor are now shown explicitly
  instead of being represented by quantities of necessaries for
  subsistence. 
- The relative values of commodities are in proportion to their labor
  cost, i.e. the quantity of labor which directly and indirectly gone to
  produce them. (See [[appendix_a][Appendix "On Sub-Systems"]])
- Sraffa asserts "at no other wage-level do values follow a simple
  rule".
  - This is fairly cryptic. Does he mean values will not
    be in proportion to the quantity of labor which directly and
    indirectly produce the commodities? Or does he mean something else?
*** 15. Variety in the proportions of labor to Means of Production
#+NAME: section_15
- Lets consider, starting from the situation where the whole national
  income goes to labor, we imagine wages are reduced: a rate of profits
  will emerge.
- The key (to the movement of relative prices consequent upon a change in
  the wage) lies in the inequality of the proportions in which labor and
  the means of production are used in the various industries. 
- If the proportion were the same in all industries, no price-changes
  could ensue regardless of any diversity of the commodity-composition
  of the means of production in different industries.
- For in each industry, an equal deduction from the wage would yield
  just as much as required for paying profits on its means of production
  at a uniform rate without disturbing existing prices.
  - In these "proportions", the means of production must be measured by
    their values. But since values may change with a change in the wage,
    the question emerges: which values?
  - The answer is---as regards establishing the equality or inequality
    of the proportions (that's all we're concerned with at the
    moment)---all possible sets of values give the same result.
  - In effect, as we have seen, if the proportions of all the industries
    are equal, then values (and therefore proportions) do not change
    with the wage.
  - From this it follows if the proportions are unequal at the set of
    values corresponding to one wage, they cannot be equal at any other,
    and so they are unequal at all values.
*** 16. "Deficit-Industries" and "Surplus-Industries"
#+NAME: section_16
- For the same reason, it is impossible for prices to remain unchanged
  when there is inequality of "proportions".
- Suppose prices /did/ remain unchanged when the wage was reduced and a
  rate of profits emerged.
  - Since in any one industry what was saved through the wage-reduction
    would depend on the number of men employed---while what was necessary
    for paying profits at a uniform rate would depend on the aggregate
    value of the means of production used---industries with a
    sufficiently low proportion of labor to means of production would
    have a deficit...while industries with a sufficiently high
    proportion would have a *surplus*, on their payments for wages and profits.
  - Nothing is assumed at the moment as to what rate of profits
    correspond to what wage reduction; all we require at this stage is
    there should be a uniform wage and a uniform rate of profits
    throughout the system.
*** 17. A Watershed Proportion
#+NAME: section_17
- There would be a "critical proportion" of labor to means of production
  which marked the watershed between "deficit" and "surplus" industries.
- An industry with such a proportion would show an *even balance*---the
  proceeds of the wage-reduction would provide *exactly* what was
  required for the payment of profits at the general rate.
- Whatever the precise value of that "proportion" in any system, it can
  be said /a priori/ that---in a system with two or more basic
  industries---the industry with the lowest proportion of labor to means
  of production would be a "deficit" industry and the one with the
  highest proportion would be a "surplus" industry.
*** 18. Price-Changes to Redress Balance
#+NAME: section_18
- Thus with a wage-reduction, price-changes would +be called for+ necessary to
  redress the balance in each of the "deficit" and "surplus" industries.
- We expect the price-ratio between each product and its means of
  production "to come into play".
  - Consider the "deficit" industry when wage is reduced. A rise in the
    price of the produce relatively to the means of production would
    help to eliminate the deficit, since it would release some of that
    share of the gross product into the industry which had been going to
    pay for the replacement of the (now cheapened) means of production.
    
    This would be added to the quantity available for the distribution
    as wages or profits.
    
    The price rise by itself would thus result in an increase in the
    magnitude (and "not merely in the value") of that part of the
    product of the industry which is available for distribution, despite
    the methods of production remaining unchanged.
- A further effect of the rise in the price of the product (relative
  to the means of production) would be to help a given quantity of
  product to go a "longer way" towards achieving the required rate of
  profit.
- Independent of this, the steeper the rise in the product's price
  relative to labor, the smaller the quantity of it absorbed by the wage.
- Conversely, price-movements in the opposite direction would accomplish
  the disposal of the surplus which otherwise would appear in an
  industry using a high "proportion" of labor to the means of production.
*** 19. Price-Ratios of Product ot Means of Production
#+NAME: section_19
- It does not follow that the price of the product of an industry
  having a low proportion of labor to means of production (and hence a
  "potential deficit") would necessarily rise, with a wage-reduction,
  relative to its own means of production. 
  
  "On the contrary," Sraffa writes, "it might possibly fall." The reason
  for this seeming contradiction: the means of production for an
  industry are themselves the product of one or more industries which
  (in turn)
  may employ a still lower proportion of labour to the means of
  production (and the same may be said for these commodities' means of
  production; etc.)
  
  In this case, the price of the product --- although produced by a
  "deficit" industry --- might *fall* in terms of its means of
  production. Its deficiency would have to be ade good through a
  particularly steep rise relative to labor.
- Result: as wages fall, the price of the product for a low-proportion
  ("deficit") industry may rise or fall, or even alternate in rising and
  falling, relative to its means of production...while the price of
  the product of a high-proportion ("surplus") industry may fall or
  rise, or alternate. What neither can do, as we will see in
  \sect\sect[[section_21][21]]--[[section_21][22]], is remain stable in price relative to its
  means of production throughout any range (long or short) of the
  wage-variation. 
*** 20. Price-Ratios between Products
#+NAME: section_20
- These considerations dominate the price-relation of a product to its
  means of production *and* equally to its relations to any other product.
- It's the "proportions" of labor to means of production which
  determines the relative "price" between commodities. NB: this is
  iterative, so those means of production used up are subject to the
  same method determining its "relative price".
- The net result and justification for price-variations from a change in
  distribution remains a simple one: redressing the balance in each industry.
*** 21. A Recurrent Proportion
#+NAME: section_21
- We can now revert to the "critical proportion" (mentioned in
  \sect[[section_17][17]]) as the border between "deficit" industries and "surplus"
  ones.
- *Assumption.*
  Suppose we had an industry sector with that "critical proportion" of
  means of production to labor, and moreover each sector (producing each
  commodity used as a means of production) are themselves in this
  "critical proportion" state...and all the sectors involved in
  producing the means of production used in the production of the means
  of production are in that critical state, and so on.
- The commodity produced in such a sector would have its value not be
  affected when wages rose or fell. This can only happen from a
  potential deficit or surplus...but we assumed the industry was "in balance"!
  - NB: A commodity of this sort would not change its value relative to
    other commodities.
- Two separate conditions have been assumed to attain this result:
  1. The "balancing" proportion is used", and
  2. one and the same proportion /recurs/ in all successive layers of
     the industry's aggregate means of production without limit.
- Note the second condition /implies/ the first. This is the subject of
  the next section...
*** 22. Balacing Ratio and Maximum Rate of Profits
#+NAME: section_22
- It will be convenient to replace the "proportion" (quantity of labor
  to means of production) with one of the corresponding "pure" ratios
  between homogeneous quantities.
  
  There are two such ratios: 
  1. the quantity-ratio of direct to indirect labor employed; and
  2. the value-ratio of net product to means of production.
  
  These two ratios coincide when the value-ratio is calculated at the
  values for /w/ = 1.
  
  Sraffa uses the latter ratio here.
- The rate of profits is uniform in all industries (and depends only on
  the wage), the value-ratio of the net product to the means of
  production is in general different for each industry and mainly
  depends on its particular circumstances of production.
- *Exception:* When we make the wage zero (i.e., /w/ = 0) and the whole
  net product goes to profits, in each industry the value-ratio of the
  net product to means of production necessarily comes to coincide with
  the general rate of profits /r/. At this level the "value ratios" of
  all industries are equal, regardless of how different the "value
  ratios" may have been at other wage-levels.
- The only "value-ratio" which can be invariant to changes in wage (and
  thus capable of being "recurrent" in the sense defined in \sect[[section_21][21]])
  is the one that is equal to the rate of profits corresponding with
  zero wage. And /that/ is the "balancing" ratio.
- *Definition.* The "*Maximum Rate of Profits*" is the rate of profits
  as it would be if the whole national income went to profits, and we
  denote it by /R/.
** Ch. 4. The Standard Commodity
*** 23. "An invariable measure of value"
#+NAME: section_23
- So we chose some commodity which we took as our "yard stick" measuring
  value. But we have a problem: how do we measure the changes of value
  over time?
  
  If we express everything in its exchangeability expressed in eggs,
  what happens when the value of an egg changes?
  
  It becomes impossible to determine price-fluctuations...whether it
  emerges from the commodity or the particular "yard stick's" value
  changes.
  - The "relevant peculiarities" consists only in the inequality in the
    ratio of labor to means of production in the "successive layers"
    into which a commodity and the aggregate of its means of production
    can be analysed. 
- The "balanced" commodity which we considered in \sect[[section_21][21]] would present
  no peculiarities we just discussed.
  - We admit that as wages fell, such a "balanced commodity" would be as
    susceptible to change in price (relative to other individual
    commodities) as anything else could. *BUT* we should know any such
    fluctuations would originate in the peculiarities of the production
    of the compared commodity...the change would *not* occur on its own.
*** 24. The perfect Composite Commodity
#+NAME: section_24
- It's doubtful any single commodity posses the desired properties.
- A *mixture* of commodities, or a "composite commodity", would do
  equally well...or even better, since it could be "blended" to suit our
  requirements.
  - Economists use the term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_basket][Basket]] instead of "composite commodity".
- The mixture of commodities needs to consists of the same commodities
  as its aggregate means of production...i.e., if we take our
  concoction, then substitute for each commodity its inputs (means of
  productions), then we should have our concoction remain invariant.
  - NB: This is a symmetry condition! One could apply representation
    theory, but that would be overkill...
- Sraffa asks: can such a commodity be constructed? (I'm going to guess "yes"...)
*** 25. Construction of such a commodity: example
#+NAME: section_25
- The problem really concerns industries rather than commodities...so we
  should approach it from that angle.
- Suppose we pick out a subspace (a "subeconomy" if you will) that forms
  a "complete miniature system" with some property. Specifically, we
  want its various commodities represented among its aggregate means of
  production in /the same proportions/ as they are among its products.
- Consider an example:
  #+begin_verse
  90 t iron + 120 t coal +  60 qr wheat + (3/16) labor \to 180 t iron
  50 t iron + 125 t coal + 150 qr wheat + (5/16) labor \to 450 t coal
  40 t iron +  40 t coal + 200 qr wheat + (8/16) labor \to 480 qr wheat
  #+end_verse
  Notice the columns sum to 180 t iron, 285 t coal, and 410 qr
  wheat...the labor sums to 1 as usual.
  - *Pop quiz:* What's the national income of this economy?
  - *Solution:* We see iron is completely self-replacing, but the other
    two sectors have surplus. Thus we see the surplus consists of 165 t
    coal and 70 qr wheat. This gives us the national income.
- How do we obtain a reduced-scale system?
  - We need to reduce the sectors with surplus. Note if we do this,
    without reducing the iron sector, then automatically the iron sector
    will have surplus!
  - We set up a system of equations, neglecting labor:
    #+begin_verse
    90 t + 120 c +  60 q \to 180 t
    /p_{1}/ (50 t + 125 c + 150 q)\to /p_{1}/ (450 c)
    /p_{2}/ (40 t +  40 c + 200 q)\to /p_{2}/ (480 q)
    #+end_verse
    where we are trying to find /p_{1}/ and /p_{2}/ such that the 
    ratio of the sum of the inputs to the outputs are the same (so the
    ratio of the sum of the iron inputs across all sectors to iron
    produced is the same as the coal inputs across all sectors to the
    coal produced). 
    
    So our system of equations may be derived from
    #+begin_verse
    (90 + /p_{1}/ 50 + /p_{2}/ 40)/180 = (120 + /p_{1}/ 125 + /p_{2}/ 40)/(/p_{1}/ 450)
                         = (60 + /p_{1}/ 150 + /p_{2}/ 200)/(/p_{2}/ 480)
    #+end_verse
    which works if and only if /p_{1}/ = 3/5, and /p_{2}/ = 3/4.
  - Thus our system becomes 
    #+begin_verse
    90 t iron + 120 t coal +  60 qr wheat + (3/16) labor \to 180 t iron
    30 t iron +  75 t coal +  90 qr wheat + (3/16) labor \to 270 t coal
    30 t iron +  30 t coal + 150 qr wheat + (6/16) labor \to 360 qr wheat
    #+end_verse
- The proportions which the three commodities are produced in the new
  system (180 : 270 : 360) are equal to the proportions which they enter
  its aggregate means of production (150 : 225 : 300). THe composite
  commodity sought for is accordingly made up in the proportions
  #+begin_verse
  1 t. iron : 1.5 t. coal : 2 qr. wheat.
  #+end_verse
- *Remark.* Again, this seems familiar compared with, e.g., Marx's
  notion of the "total or expanded form of value" discussed in
  [[http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S3b][/Das Kapital/, Ch. 1, \sect 3]].
*** 26. Standard Commodity Defined
#+NAME: section_26
- *Definitions.* We shall call this sort of mixture the *Standard composite commodity*,
  or /Standard commodity/ for short. The set of equations taken in the
  proportions producing the standard commodity we call the *Standard system*.
- In any actual economic system, a miniature Standard system's embedded
  in it...which can be brought to light by "chipping off" the unwanted
  bits. (The same way a system not in a self-reproducing state can be
  transformed into a self-reproducing subsystem.)
- What do we take as the "unit" of the Standard commodity?
  - The quantity of the Standard commodity that would form the net
    product of a Standard system employing the whole annual labor of the system.
    
    That is to say, the output for a standard system when the labor
    column sums to 1.
  - In our example, the labor column sums to (12/16). We need to
    "enlarge" each sector by (1/3). As a result, the system becomes:
    #+begin_verse
    120 t iron + 160 t coal +  80 qr wheat + (1/4) labor \to 240 t iron
     40 t iron + 100 t coal + 120 qr wheat + (1/4) labor \to 360 t coal
     40 t iron +  40 t coal + 200 qr wheat + (2/4) labor \to 480 qr wheat
    #+end_verse
    Observe the surplus in this system is: 40 t iron, 60 t. coal, and 80
    qr. wheat. Thus --- insofar as I understand this --- 
    the unit would consist of 40 t. iron, 60 t. coal, and 80 qr. wheat.
- *Definition.* Such a unit we shall call the *Standard net product* or *Standard national income*.
*** 27. Equal Percentage Excess
#+NAME: section_27
- The rate which the quantity produced exceeds the quantity used up in
  production is the same in each sector for a Standard system. Why?
  Simple: in the Standard system the various commodities produced are in
  the same proportion as they enter the aggregate means of production.
- In our running example, the rate for each commodity is 20%. (You see,
  the surplus divided by the input for any commodity is 20%; 40 t. iron
  divided by 200 t. iron is 40/200=1/5=20%.)
- Observe for the surplus sectors, when we add the input together then
  multiply by 120%, we recover the output from the transformed system
  described in \sect[[section_25][25]].
*** 28. Standard Ratio (/R/) of Net Product to Means of Production
#+NAME: section_28
- *Definition.* The rate which applies to individual commodities *is* also the
  rate which the total product of the Standard system exceeds its
  aggregate means of production, i.e., the ratio of the net product to
  the means of production of the system.  This ratio we call the
  *Standard ratio*.
- Note we didn't say the ratio /of the values/ of the net product to the
  means of production! This is because both collections are made up in
  the same proportions---because they're quantities of the same
  composite commodity.
- So if we wrote the standard commodity as \sigma, for simplicity, then
  the ratio would be (/x/\sigma)/(/y/\sigma). If we used the values,
  then we modify \sigma\to\sigma', and the ratio remains the same.
  
  Hence the ratio of the values of the two aggregates would *inevitably*
  always be the ratio of the quantities of their components.
- In the Standard system, the ratio of the net product to means of
  production would remain the same...regardless of variations in the
  division of net product between wages and profits, and regardless of
  consequent price changes.
*** 29. Standard Ratio and Rates of Profits
#+NAME: section_29
- If we use a fraction of the net product instead, everything that has
  been stated holds...why? Because we are working with multiples of a
  composite commodity! So the ratio of such a fraction to the means of
  production will remain *unaffected* by any variations of prices.
- Suppose the Standard net product is divided between wages and profits
  (taking care that the share of each consists of Standard
  commodity). The resulting rate of profits would be in the same
  proportion to the Standard ratio of the system as allotted to profits
  was to the whole of the system.
- *Example.* Our running example given above, where the Standard ratio
  was 20%. If (3/4) of the Standard national income went to wages, and
  (1/4) to profits, then the rate of profits would be 5%...why? Because
  (1/4) of 20% is precisely 5%! If half went to each, the rate of
  profits would be 10%. And if the whole went to profit, the rate of
  profits would reach its maximum level of 20% and coincide with the
  Standard ratio.
  - *Exercise.* It seems difficult for me to grasp that this transformed
    matrix would produce, from this procedure, the desired
    eigenvalue. One should probably rigorously prove this...and by
    "one", I mean "I"...
- The rate of profits in the Standard system therefore appears as a
  ratio between quantities of commodities irrespective of their prices.
*** 30. Relation between wage and rate of profits in Standard System
#+NAME: section_30
- Let us re-capitulate what has been determined:
    
  If /R/ is the Standard ratio or Maximum rate of profits, and /w/ is
  the proportion of the net product that goes to wages, the rate of
  profit is
  #+begin_verse
  /r/ = /R/ (1 - /w/).
  #+end_verse
  Thus as wages gradually reduce from 1 to 0, the rate of profits
  increase /in direct proportion/. The relationship is a straight line
  plotted on the axes (/r/, /w/).
*** 31. Relation Extended to any system
#+NAME: section_31
- Now, here we should note we've been working with a very peculiar
  "Standard system"...but does our results hold for *any* arbitrary
  economic system? (C.f., my exercise in \sect[[section_29][29]].)
- The question is equivalent to determining whether the decisive role
  the Standard commodity plays lies in its
  1. being the constituent material of national income and of the means
     of production (which is unique to the Standard system); or
  2. in its supplying the medium in which wages are estimated?
  For the latter is a function which the appropriate Standard commodity
  can fulfil in any case, regardless whether the system in in Standard
  proportions or not.
- The second alternative /appears/ wrong.

** Ch. 5. Uniqueness of the Standard System
*** 36. Introductory
#+NAME: section_36
- Sraffa will prove there exists precisely one way to transform a given
  economic system into a Standard system. 
*** 37. Transformation into a Standard system always possible
#+NAME: section_37
- We may show this using an "imaginary experiment" (Sraffa's term for a
  "thought experiment"?).
- It involves two types of alternating steps:
  1. Changing the proportions of the industries;
  2. Reducing the same ratio the quantities produced by all industries,
     while leaving unchanged the quantities used as means of production.
- We adjust the proportions of all industries in our system such that:
  every basic commodity produces more than strictly necessary for
  replacement. (I.e., every basic commodity has surplus.)
  - Is this always possible mathematically?
- Suppose we gradually reduce the product of all industries, slowly and
  successively in small steps...but without interfering with the
  quantities of labor and means of production they employ.
  - I honestly don't see how this is done. We decrease the output
    without changing the input?
- When the cuts reduce production for any one commodity to the minimum
  level required for replacement, we re-adjust the proportions of the
  industries so there's a surplus for each product again (while keeping
  onstant the quantity of labor employed in the aggregate.)
  
  We can always do this, provided there exists a surplus for some
  commodities and deficit of none
- We continue alternatng between cuts and re-establishing a surplus for
  each product until we reach the point where products have been reduced
  such that all-round replacement is just possible without leaving
  anything as surplus.
  - *Remark.* Notice this is an /algorithm/! Sraffa's mathematical
    approach may be described as /algorithmic/ or /constructive/ (the
    latter for mathematicians, the former for everyone else).
- With increasing the quantity produced in each sector by a uniform
  rate, we are able to restore the original conditions. We do not
  disturb the proportions to which the industries have been
  brought. The uniform rate restoring the original conditions of
  produciton is /R/, and the proportions attained by the industries are
  the Standard proportions!
*** 38. Why question of uniqueness arises
#+NAME: section_38
- Is the Standard system unique, or are there other ways to get the same result?
- The equations of the /q/-system \sect[[section_33][33]] are reducible to an equation
  of the /k/-th degree in /R/. The [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremofAlgebra.html][fundamental theorem of algebra]] tells
  us there are at most /k/ different solutions!
- It is sufficient to prove there cannot be more than one value of /R/
  which corresponds to an all-positive set of /q/'s. This implies
  [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniquenessTheorem.html][uniqueness]] of the Standard System.
*** 39. Prices Positive at all wage levels
#+NAME: section_39
- First, we must show -- as there always exists a possible set of
  multipliers (\sect[[section_37][37]]) -- there exists at all values of wage (including
  zero) a set of prices satisfying the condition of replacement of the
  means of production with uniform profits. I.e., there exists a set of
  /positive/ values of /p/'s.
- We consider /w/ = 1 where, since prices equal labor costs (\sect[[section_14][14]]),
  the values of the /p/'s must necessarily all be positive.
  - If the value of /w/ is moved continuously from 1 to 0, the values of
    the /p/'s will also move continuously...so any /p/ that becomes
    negative *must* pass through 0.
  - However, while wages and profits are positive, the price of no
    commodity can become 0 until the price of at least one of the other
    commodities entering its means of production becomes negative.
  - Thus, since no /p/ can become negative before any other, none can
    become negative at all.
  - *Footnote.* For this proof to be complete, we must show that the
    /p/'s representing prices of basic products cannot become negative
    through becoming infinite---unlike the /p/'s of non-basics which can
    do so. Sraffa shows this in "Note on Self-reproducing Non-basics"
    (Appendix B).
*** 40. Production equations with zero wages
#+NAME: section_40
- For comparison purposes, we rewrite here the production equations as
  they appear when wages vanish (i.e., when /w/ = 0).
- The labor terms may be omitted (since we multiply them with 0), and we
  use the maximum rate of profits /R/ for /r/.
- We can take the price of any one of the commodities as unity.
- The production system becomes
  #+begin_verse
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Ap_{a}/
  (/A_{b}p_{a}/ + /B_{b}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Bp_{b}/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  (/A_{k}p_{a}/ + /B_{k}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Kp_{k}/
  #+end_verse
*** 41. Unique set of positive multipliers
#+NAME: section_41
We can show now there can be no more than one set of positive
multipliers! We will enumerate the steps in Sraffa's proof...

1. Let /R'_{}/ be a possible value of /R/ to which there correspond
   *positive* prices /p'_{a}/, /p'_{b}/, ..., /p'_{k}/ and *positive*
   multipliers /q'_{a}/, /q'_{b}/, ..., /q'_{k}/. 
   
   Let /R''_{}/ be another possible value of /R/ with corresponding
   prices /p''_{a}/, ..., /p''_{k}/ and multipliers /q''_{a}/, ...,
   /q''_{k}/. 
   
   We must prove it is impossible for the /q"_{}/'s to all be positive.
2. Consider the production equations (with /w/ = 0), using /R'_{}/ for
   /R/, and /p'_{a}/, ..., /p'_{k}/ for /p_{a}/, ..., /p_{k}/. Then
   multiply the /p'_{}/'s respectively by /q''_{a}/, ..., /q''_{k}/. We obtain
   #+begin_verse
   /q''_{a}/ (/A_{a}p'_{a}/ + /B_{a}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p'_{k}/)(1 + /R'_{}/) = /q''_{a}Ap'_{a}/
   /q''_{b}/ (/A_{b}p'_{a}/ + /B_{b}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p'_{k}/)(1 + /R'_{}/) = /q''_{b}Bp'_{b}/
   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
   /q''_{k}/ (/A_{k}p'_{a}/ + /B_{k}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p'_{k}/)(1 + /R'_{}/) = /q''_{k}Kp'_{k}/
   #+end_verse
3. Add all the equations in our system (from step 2) together:
   #+begin_verse
   [ /q''_{a}/ (/A_{a}p'_{a}/ + /B_{a}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p'_{k}/)
     + /q''_{b}/ (/A_{b}p'_{a}/ + /B_{b}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p'_{k}/)
     + ...
     + /q''_{k}/ (/A_{k}p'_{a}/ + /B_{k}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p'_{k}/)](1 + /R'_{}/)
    = (/q''_{a}Ap'_{a}/ + /q''_{b}Bp'_{b}/ + ... + /q''_{k}Kp'_{k}/)
   #+end_verse
4. Now, if we work with the /q/-equations (as given in \sect[[section_30][30]]) taking
   /R''_{}/ for /R/ and /q''_{a}/, ..., /q''_{k}/ for /q_{a}/, ...,
   /q_{k}/; then multiplying them respectively by /p'_{a}/, ...,
   /p'_{k}/, we obtain
   #+begin_verse
   /p'_{a}/ (/A_{a}q''_{a}/ + /A_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}q''_{k}/)(1 + /R"_{}/) = /p'_{a}Aq"_{a}/
   /p'_{b}/ (/B_{a}q''_{a}/ + /B_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /B_{k}q''_{k}/)(1 + /R"_{}/) = /p'_{b}Bq"_{b}/
   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
   /p'_{k}/ (/K_{a}q''_{a}/ + /K_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}q''_{k}/)(1 + /R"_{}/) = /p'_{k}Kq"_{k}/
   #+end_verse
5. We add up all the equations in step 4 to get the equation
   #+begin_verse
   [ /p'_{a}/ (/A_{a}q''_{a}/ + /A_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}q''_{k}/)

6. The terms in the equation from step 1 are identical with those of the
   equation in step 2, despite grouped differently. The only exception?
   We have /R'_{}/ in one, and /R"_{}/ in the other.
   
   Thus for the equations to be true, both sides of both equations must
   be equal to zero: which (since all the /p/'s are positive) implies
   some of the /q"_{}/'s must be negative.
   - This prove *if* there exists a set of positive values for the
     /p/'s, then there can be no more than one set of positive values
     for the /q/'s.
   - *Footnote.* Sraffa notes a similar argument, only putting in the
     /p"_{}/'s and the /q'_{}/'s instead of the /p'_{}/'s and the
     /q"_{}/'s proves: if there exists a set of positive values for
     the /q/'s, then there can be no more than one set of positive values for
     the /p/'s.
7. We had previously seen (in \sect[[section_37][37]]) there always exists a set of
   positive /q/'s and (in \sect[[section_39][39]]) there always exists a set of positive
   /p/'s. We can therefore conclude there exists always one and only one
   value of /R/ and a corresponding set of positive multipliers (/q/'s)
   which transform a given economic system into a Standard system.
*** 42. Positive multipliers correspond to /lowest/ value of /R/
#+NAME: section_42
- We can show a corollary: the value of /R/ which corresponds to
  all-positive prices (which we shall call /R'_{}/) is the *lowest* of
  the /k/ possible values of /R/.
- We assume for contradiction this is not true. Then there exists a
  value of /R/ *lower* than /R'_{}/ which we shall call /R"_{}/. As an
  example, make /R'_{}/ = 15% and /R"_{}/ = 10%.
- To determine if this is possible, we revert to the system with /w/ and
  /r/ (\sect[[section_11][11]]). We assign as wage a quantity of the Standard commodity,
  which corresponds to /R'_{}/. Thus we replace the labor terms
  (/L_{a}w/, /L_{b}w/, etc.) with proportionate quantities of the
  Standard commodity, such that their total is a fraction of the
  Standard national income:
\begin{equation}
1-\frac{R''}{R'}
\end{equation}
- (In the example we have chosen, this would be 1/3).
- At the same time we take as standard of prices an arbitrarily chosen
  basic commodity /a/ and make its value equal to unity (i.e., /p_{a}/ = 1).
- Consider two sets of solutions for the resulting system. One
  corresponds to /R'_{}/ giving us
  #+begin_verse
  /r/ = /R'_{}/ [1-(1/3)] = 10%
  #+end_verse
  and /all-positive prices/ (since -- being positive at /r/ = /R'_{}/ --
  they will always be positive for all values of /r/ \ge 0; c.f. \sect[[section_39][39]]).
- The second set of solutions corresponds to /R"_{}/. We know from the
  last section, when prices correspond to /R"_{}/, the value of the
  Standard commodity (formed in proportions correspond to /R'_{}/) is
  zero. So wages vanish and
  #+begin_verse
  /r/ = /R"_{}/ = 10%.
  #+end_verse
  This implies among the prices corresponding to /R"_{}/ *some must be negative and others positive.*
- The two sets thus give the same value (10%) for /r/ but two different
  sets of prices.
- But this is impossible: given any single value for /r/, there exists
  only one corresponding set of prices. In effect, when /r/ is replaced
  by a known number (e.g., 10%) the equations form a linear system and
  for the remaining unknowns there exists a unique set of solutions.
  - *Footnote.* In these conditions, one of the equations is implicit in
    the others (see \sect[[section_3][3]], last paragraph) and the number (/k/ - 1) of
    independent equations is equal to the number of the remaining unknowns.
- Thus /R'_{}/ (the value of /R/ which corresponds to all-positive
  prices) cannot be higher -- and hence must be lower -- than any other
  value /R"_{}/ which corresponds to some positive and some negative prices.
  - *Footnote.* It may be noted the straight line relation represented
    by
    #+begin_quote
    /r/ = /R/ (1 - /w/)
    #+end_quote
    would continue to hold if wage were measured in any of the other
    Standard commodities which correspond to the possible values of /R/
    higher than /R'_{}/ (if it is possible to conceive of Standard
    commodities which include negative components; Sraffa addresses this in
    Ch. 8).
    
    The prices for various Standard commodities (relative to each other)
    would with change of /r/ move such that -- although wage would
    represent different proportions of the respective Standard national
    incomes -- these different fractions of different Standard incomes would
    all be of equal value.
    
    When /r/ was made equal to /R'_{}/ the wage in terms of any one of
    the Standard commodities would consist of a nonzero quantity of such
    Standard commodity...but the value of the latter would be zero if
    expressed in terms of the Standard ocmmodity formed by means of
    all-positive multipliers and which corresponds to /R'_{}/.

** Ch. 6. Reduction to Dated Labor
*** 45. Cost of production aspect
#+NAME: section_45
- Sraffa considers prices from their "cost of production" aspect, and
  examines the way they "resolve themselves" into wages and profits.
- Sraffa would have introduced the argument earlier "had it not been for
  the necessity of following one line of argument at a time".
*** 46. "Reduction" defined
#+NAME: section_46
- *Definition.* We call "Reducation to Dated Quantities of Labor" (or
  "/Reduction/" for short) an operation where the equation for a
  commodity, the different means of production used are replaced with
  a series of quantities of labor, each with its appropriate "date".
- Consider the equation representating the production for commodity
  '/a/' (where wage and prices are expressed in terms of the Standard
    commodity):
  #+begin_quote
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{a}w/ = /Ap_{a}/
  #+end_quote
  - We start with replacing the commodities forming the means of
    production for /A/ with *their own* means of production and
    quantities of Labor. 

    In other words: we replace them with the commodities and labor which
    (as appears from their own respective equations) must be employed to
    reproduce those means of production; and they, having been expended
    a year earlier (\sect[[section_9][9]]), will be multiplied by a profit factor at a
    compound rate for the appropriate period...namely, the means of
    production by (1 + /r/)^{2} and labor by (1 + /r/).
  - It may be noted that /A_{a}/ --- the quantity of commodity /a/
    itself used in the production of /A/ --- is to be treated like any
    other means of production...i.e., replaced by its own means of
    production and labor.
  - *Remark.* Here we are "almost dynamic" but "still quite static"! We
    are taking into account time, kind of, but we are really...not.
- We next replace *these latter* means of production with their own
  means of production and labor, and to these will be applied a profit
  factor for one more year. Or to the means of production (1 +
  /r/)^{3} and to the labor (1 + /r/)^{2}.
- We can carry this operation on as far as we like. If next to the
  direct labor /L_{a}/ we place the successive aggregate quantities of
  labor which we collect at each step and we call respectively
  /L_{a(1)}/, /L_{a(2)}/, ..., /L_{a(n)}/, ..., we shall obtain the
  "*Reduction Equation*" for the product in the form of an infinite
    series
  #+begin_quote
  /L_{a}w/ + /L_{a(1)}w/ (1 + /r/) + ... + /L_{a(n)}w/ (1 + /r/)^{n} + ... = /Ap_{a}/.
  #+end_quote
- How far reduction needs to be pushed in order to obtain a given degree
  of approximation depends on the level of the rate of profits: the
  nearer the latter is to its maximum, the further must the reduction be
  carried.
- Beside the labor terms, there will always be a "commodity residue"
  consisting of minute fractions of every basic production; but it is
  always possible, by carrying the reduction sufficiently far, to render
  the residue so small as to have a negligible effect on price (at any
  prefixed rate of profits short of /R/).
  - *Remark.* I object to this supposition. If we carry this operation
    "infinitely far back", then we carry it back to a time predating
    humans. From a strictly historical perspective, humans began with
    labor alone and constructed simple tools...then constructed complex
    tools. Sraffa, I believe, errs suggesting "things were as they are"
    --- a common sin among Economists!
- Sraffa notes only at /r/ = /R/ the residue becomes all-important as
  the sole determinant of the price of the product.
  - Mathematically, this makes sense since /w/ = 0 when /r/ = /R/. Hence
    the infinite series sums infinitely many zeroes.
