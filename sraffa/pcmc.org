* Part I. Single-Product Industries and Circulating Capital
** Ch. 1. Production for Subsistence

*** <<section_1>>1. Two Commodities 
- We consider an economy with two commodities, producing just enough to
  maintain itself.
- *Assumption.* Commodities are produced by separate industries.
  - This is a simplifying assumption which can be lifted, a single
    industry could produce multiple commodities. For example, a beer
    brewery produces beer (duh) and animal feed (from the used up [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashing][mash]])
    immediately. Since this brewery example is needlessly complicated,
    and distracts from the underlying ideas, we'll put it on the back
    burner until later.
- *Assumption (Cycle of Exchange).*
  Commodities are exchanged at a market held after the harvest.
  - In practice this means we are assuming a discrete time variable. The
    comic book picture I have, at least, is there's two snapshots: (1)
    before production, at the start of the year; and (2) after
    production, at the end of the year.
  - Consequently, the only possibility for changes in the economy are at
    these annual events. In between these events, the economy is assumed
    to be unchanging. Because of this, the model being setup seems
    /static/ to me.
- Wheat an iron are produced, representing sustenance for the
  workers and the means of production (respectively). 
- We suppose that 280 quarters of wheat and 12 tons of iron are used
  to produce 400 quarters of wheat, whereas 120 quarters of wheat
  and 8 tons of iron are used to produce 20 tons of iron. We
  represent a year's operations as: \\

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
   280 qr. wheat + 12 t. iron \to 400 qr. wheat
   120 qr. wheat +  8 t. iron \to 20  t. iron.
  #+END_VERSE 

  - Note that when we add up the columns, it's *equal* to the
    output. This is what we mean when we say "There is no surplus."
  - *Definition.*
    These equations or relations Sraffa calls "the methods of production and
    productive consumption" or *the methods of production*.
- There exists a unique set of exchange-values which (if adopted by the
  market) restores the original distribution of products, making it
  possible for the process to repeat.
  - Such values "spring directly" from the methods of production.
  - Elementary linear algebra shows us 10 qr. wheat must be exchanged for
    1 t. of iron.
  - *Static Equilibrium Assumption.*
    This implicitly assumes we are working in a static equilibrium. We
    have discussed the "static" bit with the assumption of annual
    cycles, the "equilibrium" bit may need some explanation. Well, not
    really: we're describing a state in which economic forces are
    balanced (hence the "reproduction of the same state" bit). The means
    of production used /in the next production process/ turns out to be
    *identical* to that used in the previous production process.
*** <<section_2>>2. Three or More
- The same applies to any number of commodities. For example, if we add
  a third sector (pigs): \\
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
240 qr. wheat + 12 t. iron + 18 pigs \to 450 qr. wheat
90  qr. wheat +  6 t. iron + 12 pigs \to 21 t. iron
120 qr. wheat +  3 t. iron + 30 pigs \to 60 pigs
  #+END_VERSE
- The exchange values which ensure replacement all around are 10 qr
  wheat = 1 t iron = 2 pigs.
- The general procedure for calculating this is to "normalize the
  output", in the sense of dividing each qr of wheat by 450, dividing
  each t of iron by 21, and dividing each pig by 60, (more generally,
  divide each widget by the quantity of widgets produced), so we consider
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
(8/15) qr. wheat + (4/7) t. iron + (3/10) pigs \to 1 qr. wheat
(3/15) qr. wheat + (2/7) t. iron + (2/10) pigs \to 1 t. iron
(4/15) qr. wheat + (1/7) t. iron + (5/10) pigs \to 1 pig
  #+END_VERSE
- Then we just use linear algebra to solve this as usual.
*** <<section_3>>3. General Case
- We have commodities of different "species" (e.g., iron, wheat,
  etc.). Lower case variables will keep track of each species /a/, /b/,
  /c/, ..., /k/. NB: the term "species" is mine, not Sraffa's.
  - *Caution:* Sraffa abuses notation and mixes up /A/ and /a/ when
    referring to the species.
  - *Abuse of Notation:* We will write /k/ to indicate the number of
    sectors, as well as its proper meaning. It will depend on the
    context, but it should be clear when used.
- We denote /A/ the quantity annually produced of /a/, /B/ the quantity
  annually produced of /b/, etc.
- We will call /A_a/, /B_a/, ..., /K_a/ the quantities of /a/, /b/, ...,
  /k/ annually used in the industry producing /a/, and so on.
- The values are the unknowns /p_a/, /p_b/, ..., /p_k/, which represent
  the value of 1 unit of the commodities /a/, /b/, ..., /k/
  (respectively) necessary to restore the initial position.
  - We don't really care about the numeric value of the /p/'s, but the
    ratios between them. For example, writing /p_{a}/ = 10 /p_{b}/ tells
    us that we could exchange 1 unit of /a/ for 10 units of /b/.
  - If we scale all the /p/'s by some nonzero constant, it leaves the
    economy unchanged...which mathematically tells us we're working with
    a projective space, not a vector space.
  - What exactly /are/ the /p/'s though? They are presented as just
    "some numbers" whose values permit the economy to reproduce. They
    /are not/ monetary prices of goods, hence cannot be interpreted as
    prices.
    - Arguably, money is a commodity with a value --- it is one of the
      sectors, and has a /p/ associated with it. The price of, say, /a/
      would be how many units of money are exchanged for 1 unit
      /a/. This is how classical economists thought of price.
    - The projective freedom creates some ambiguity in my mind for fully
      grasping /p/ intuitively. I cannot flesh out further, at the
      moment, /why/.
- We can now cast the conditions of production as: \\
  #+begin_verse
  /A_{a}p_a/ + /B_{a}p_b/ + ... + /K_{a}p_k/ = /Ap_a/
  /A_{b}p_a/ + /B_{b}p_b/ + ... + /K_{b}p_k/ = /Bp_b/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  /A_{k}p_a/ + /B_{k}p_b/ + ... + /K_{k}p_k/ = /Kp_k/
  #+end_verse
- Note that we assume the system to be in a self-replacing state, so
  /A_a/ + /A_b/ + ... + /A_k/ = /A/, /B_a/ + /B_b/ + ... + /B_k/ = /B/,
  and so on. That is to say, the sum of the first column equals the
  output of the first row, etc.
  - Again, the approach one should take is to work with modified
    quantities /A'_{a}/ = /A_{a}/ รท /A/ and so on, working with primed
    quantities as inputs and output quantities (*NOT PRICES*) set to 1. 
- It is un-necessary to assume every commodity enters /directly/ into
  the production of every other. We could have pigs enter into
  production of wheat but not iron, and no iron enter into the
  production of pigs.
- One commodity is taken as the standard measure of value, and its price
  is set to 1. This leaves /k/ - 1 unknowns. It doesn't really matter
  which commodity we pick, since the relative exchange-value doesn't
  change. This leaves /k/ - 1 independent linear equations which
  uniquely determine the /k/ - 1 prices. (This is similar to Marx's
  "general form of value" discussed in [[http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S3c][/Das Kapital/, Vol. 1, Ch. 1]].)
  - Arguably, the commodity taken as the standard of value /is/ the
    money commodity. Suppose we fix the value of a pig to be 1.
    (We're on the "pig standard", or something.)
  - Fixing the value of one of the commodities gives a clear
    interpretation of the /p/'s, as discussed in the cited bit from
    Marx: /p_{a}/ --- in the pig standard --- is the number of pigs that
    1 unit of /a/ "commands" (i.e., we exchange 1 unit of /a/ for
    /p_{a}/ pigs).  
- *Puzzle.* Consider the situation when the determinant of the
  production matrix is zero, which would happen if there are two rows or columns
  which differ by a constant multiple. What would this correspond to
  economically (i.e., how would we interpret this)? And how would we
  solve it? Could it ever happen "in reality"?
** Ch. 2. Production with a Surplus
*** <<section_4>>4. The rate of Profits
- If the economy produces more than the bare minimum necessary
  for replacement, i.e., we have some surplus to be distributed,
  then our model becomes self-contradictory.
  - Why? Because the "Gross National Product" (the right hand side) will
    contain the sum of the columns on the left hand side plus bonus
    parts. We cannot use the basic linear algebra one might naively try
    after reading my notes on chapter 1. (Alas, I fooled even myself on
    my first attempt reading Sraffa!)
- *Assumption (Profit determined simultaneously with Prices).*
  We allot the surplus /simultaneously/ as when the prices are
  determined.
  - Sraffa's justification for this assumption is as follows:
    1. We cannot allot the surplus /before/ the prices are
       determined.
       - The surplus must be distributed in proportion to
         the means of production advanced in each industry.
       - Such a proportion between two aggregates of heterogeneous
         goods ("the rate of profits") cannot be determined before we
         know the prices of goods. This is Sraffa's central thesis in
         presenting his "Standard Commodity" in Chapter 4.
    2. OTOH, we cannot defer alloting the surplus till after
       the prices are known, since the prices cannot be determined
       before knowing the rate of profits.
    3. Therefore the /distribution of the surplus/ *must* be determined
       through the *same mechanism* and at the same time as the
       /prices of commodities/.
  - The condition of a static model is critical in Sraffa's thought
    process.
    - If we were allowed to vary the economy /during/ the
      production process (e.g., if a neighboring country had a natural
      catastrophe, and --- being good neighbors --- we altered our
      production to assist; or if we considered a sort of "brewery
      example", where a product takes a year to produce "distilling"
      (i.e., unassisted from labor) and byproducts are taken to the market
      in the meantime), then (a) the economy would no longer be static,
      and (b) the rate of profits could not be determined so simply.
    - How would the rate of profits behave during such a nonlinear
      process? Arguably, we could modify Sraffa's model by "shortening"
      the time interval, and thinking of a commodity at various stages
      of production as /different goods/...we should end up with some
      differential equation as the time interval "goes to zero".
  - The assumption, however, of a static model is necessary to critique
    the Neoclassical paradigm. Sraffa is meeting them on their terms, so
    however unrealistic it might seem to me...the bone to pick is with
    the Neoclassical school, not Sraffa.
- We add the rate of profits ("which must be uniform for all
  industries") as an unknown, /r/, and the system becomes
  #+begin_verse  
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) = /Ap_{a}/
  (/A_{b}p_{a}/ + /B_{b}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) = /Bp_{b}/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
  (/A_{k}p_{a}/ + /B_{k}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) = /Kp_{k}/  
  #+end_verse
  where, since we have a self-replacing state, we need /A_{a}/ +
  /A_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}/ \le /A/, /B_{a}/ + /B_{b}/ + ... +
  /B_{k}/ \le /B/, and so on. In other words: the quantity
  produced of each commodity is /at least/ equal to the quantity
  of it used in other sectors' production together.
- The system has /k/ independent equations, which determines the
  /k - 1/ unknowns plus the rate of profit.
*** <<section_5>>5. Example of Rate of Profits

- Lets revise our example from \sect[[section_1][1]] to have a surplus:
  #+begin_verse
  280 qr. wheat + 12 t. iron \to 575 qr. wheat
  120 qr. wheat +  8 t. iron \to  20  t. iron
  #+end_verse
  The answer is 15 qr wheat = 1 t. iron will restore the initial
  condition, and the rate of profit is /r/ = 25%
  - The trick is to rewrite this as producing one unit output in
    each sector:
    #+begin_verse
    (56/115) qr. wheat + 3/5 t. iron \to 1 qr. wheat
    (24/115) qr. wheat + 2/5 t. iron \to 1 t. iron
    #+end_verse
    Then we let /p_{w}/ be the price of 1 qr. wheat, /p_{i}/ be
    the price of 1 t. iron, /r/ the rate of profits.
  - We have an eigen-problem of the form: /A/ *x* = /\lambda/ *x*   
    where /\lambda = 1/(1+r)/, /A/ is the matrix we deduced, and
    *x*  is the vector (/p_{w}/, /p_{i}/). 
  - Note that the matrix has eigenvalues /\lambda/ = 4/5, 2/23.
  - The rate of profit /r/ = /\lambda^{-1}/-1 could be either 1/4
    or 23/2. Let us try /r/ = 1/4...
  - Now that we have our solution for /r/, we plug it into one of
    the sectors at random and solve for the prices. Since 1 + /r/
    = 5/4, we see:
    #+begin_verse
    (280 /p_{w}/ + 12 /p_{i}/)(5/4) = 575 /p_{w}/
    #+end_verse
    implies 15 /p_{i}/ = 225 /p_{w}/, or equivalently 1 t. iron
    may be traded for 15 qr. wheat.
  - *Question:* What if we plugged in /r/ = 23/2 instead?
    - We then find (280 /p_{w}/ + 12 /p_{i}/)(25/2) = 575 /p_{w}/ or
      equivalently, 39 /p_{w}/ = -2 /p_{i}/...which is hard to explain
      as a coherent choice for prices.
    - An obvious constraint would be the prices must be positive, which
      restricts possible choices of /r/.
*** <<section_6>>6. Basic and Non-Basic Products
- Notice before, without surplus, all commodities produced /must/
  be used in the production of other commodities. But now, with
  surplus, we may have commodities which are not needed in the
  production process. These commodities are called *luxury* goods.
  - You should really convince yourself this must be the case,
    since we affirmed before the sum of the columns for the
    production matrix must be equal to the output. That is to
    say: the total inputs must be equal to the total
    outputs. Otherwise, by definition, there is surplus.
- Notice also the luxury goods do not affect the rate of profits.
- If the production of a given luxury good doubled with constant inputs,
  the price per unit of given luxury good would /halve/. The
  price relations of all other goods would remain the same,
  however. 
- The price of a luxury good is *not* an unknown we are trying to
  solve for, yet the prices of non-luxury goods *are* unknowns
  which we need to determine. With the non-luxury good prices
  determined, we may deduce the luxury goods prices.
- *Definition.* The criteria is: does a commodity enter (either directly or
  indirectly) the production of /all/ commodities. Those that do,
  we shall call *basic* and those which do not are *non-basic*
  commodities.
  - If we tried weakening this definition to allow /basic/ commodities
    to enter the production of all /basic/ commodities, it is entirely
    feasible to have two "subeconomies" completely decoupled from each
    other. This is bad, and something we'd like to try to
    avoid. Consequently, a basic commodity enters into the production of
    /all/ commodities.
  - We could ask /Do basic commodities really exist?/ Is there some good
    that empirically enters into the production of all commodities? I
    suppose electricity might be one, but I am at a loss to figure out
    any others...
*** <<section_7>>7. Terminological Note
- Why do we call the ratios satisfying conditions of production "values"
  or "prices" rather than "costs of production"?
- The latter would be adequate so far as *non*-basic products were
  concerned, since their exchange ratio is merely a reflection of what
  must be paid for their means of production, labor, and profits in
  order to produce---there is no mutual dependence.
- Basic products have another dimension
  - Its exchange-ratio depends on its use in the production of other
    basic commodities, as much as on the extent to which those
    commodities enter its own production.
  - One might be tempted to say "it depends as much on the Demand side
    as on the Supply side", but one would be *wrong*
- The price of non-basic products depends on the prices of its means of
  production, but these (the prices of its means of production) do not depend on it
- A basic product has the prices of its means of production depend on
  its own price no less than the latter depends on them
- Sraffa argues a "less one-sided description than cost of production
  seems therefore required".
  - Classical terms include:
    1. "necessary price" 
       - generically, the physiocrats used this term,
       - Pierre Paul Mercier de la Riviรจre, /The Natural and Essential Order of Political Societies/ "The necessary price of a piece of work
         consists of the disbursements made by the worker for the
         purchase of primary materials, and of the sum total of all his
         consumption during the work."
       - Thomas Hodgskin's
         [[http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Hodgskin/hgskPP10.html#IX.1][Popular Political Economy, IX.1]] "...the natural and necessary
         price of money being determined...by the quantity of labour
         required to produce it"
    2. "natural price" 
       - Adam Smith's /Inquiry/
         [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book01/ch04.htm][Ch. 4]], [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book01/ch07.htm][Ch. 7]] "The natural price...is...the prices of all
         commodities are continually gravitating"; 
       - David Ricardo's [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/ricardo/tax/ch04.htm][/Principles/ Ch. 5]];
       - J.S. Mill's [[http://www.econlib.org/library/Mill/mlP32.html#III.3.4][/Principles/ III.4]] "value...proportional to its cost
         of production, [is] its Natural Value (or its Natural Price)"; 
       - NB: John Locke appears to be the first(?) English economist to
         use the terms "natural price" and "market price" in [[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/locke/part1.htm][/Some Considerations of the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising the Value of Money/]]),
    3. "price of production" (e.g., Marx?)
  - But value and price have been preferred, because (a) it's shorter;
    and (b) in the present context --- which has no reference to "market
    prices" --- it's no more ambiguous.
- In general Sraffa avoids the term "cost of production", as well as the
  term "capital" (in its quantitative connotation), even at the expense
  of tiresome circumlocution
  - These terms have become inseparably linked with the supposition they
    stand for quantities which can be measured independently of --- and
    prior to --- the determination of the prices of the products.
  - Consider the "real costs" of Marshall ("But now we have to take account of the fact that the
    production of a commodity generally requires many different kinds of
    labor and the use of capital in many forms. The exertions of all
    the different kinds of labor that are directly or indirectly
    involved in making it; together with the abstinences or rather the
    waitings required for saving the capital used in making it: all
    these efforts and sacrifices together will be called the real cost
    of production of the commodity." Alfred Marshall's 
    [[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/marshall/bk5ch03.htm][Principles of Economics, Book 5, Chapter 3]]) 
    and the "quantity of capital" which is implied in the marginal
    productivity theory. 
  - Sraffa avoids suppositions which such terms connote, since he's
    trying to critique the marginalist paradigm.
*** <<section_8>>8. Subsistence-Wage and Surplus-Wage
- We have regarded wages as consisting of the necessary subsistence of
  the workers, and enters the system on equal footing as fuel for
  engines or feed for cattle.
- Sraffa takes into account the "other aspect of wages" since, besides
  the ever-present element of subsistence, they may include a share of
  the "surplus product".
- We separate the wages into two components: one is the subsistence,
  which we keep as inputs on equal footing as fuel or feed; the other is
  the "division of the surplus", which we /should/ as variable. 
  - Working with tradition, we will refrain from parting with tradition,
    and shall follow the usual practice treating the whole wage as
    variable.
- Drawback: This approach relegates the necessaries of consumption to
  the "limbo" of non-basic products. 
  - This is because the necessaries of consumption no longer appear
    alongside the other means of production, i.e., they don't appear on
    the left hand side of the equations.
  - An improvement in the methods of production for necessaries of life
    will no longer directly affect rates of profits and the prices of
    other products.
  - Necessaries are essentially basic, and if they are prevented from
    exerting influence on prices and profits under that label, they do
    so in devious ways (Sraffa suggests, e.g., "by setting a limit below
    which the wage cannot fall", a limit which would itself fall with
    any improvement in the methods of production for necessaries,
    "carrying with it a rise in the rates of profits and a change in the
    prices of other products".)
- The discussion Sraffa entertains can "easily be adapted to the more
  appropriate, if unconventional, interpretation of the wage suggested
  above". 
*** <<section_9>>9. Wages paid out of the product
- *Assumption (Wage paid after production).* We shall hereafter *assume*
  the wage is paid /post factum/ as a share of the annual product. Thus
  we *abandon* the classical economists' idea of a wage "advanced" from capital.
- *Assumption (Annual Cycle of Production).* We retain the supposition
  of an annual cycle of production with an annual market.
*** <<section_10>>10. Quantity and Quality of Labor
- The quantity of labor employed in each industry should now be
  represented explicitly, taking the place of the corresponding
  quantities of subsistence.
- We suppose labor to be uniform in quality or (what amounts to the same
  thing) we assume any difference in quality to have been previously
  reduced to equivalent differences in quantity, so each unit of labor
  receives the same wage.
- We call /L_{a}/, /L_{b}/, ..., /L_{k}/ the annual quantities of labor
  respectively employed in the industries producing /a/, /b/, ..., /k/
  and we define them as fractions of the total annual labor of society,
  which we take as unity. So: \\
  #+begin_verse
  /L_{a}/ + /L_{b}/ + ... + /L_{k}/ = 1
  #+end_verse
  - *Remark.* It seems labor is treated differently than other
    commodities. For example, it doesn't have its own "sector"
    (equation). And it's already normalized!
- We call /w/ the wage per unit of labor, which like the prices will be
  expressed in terms of the chosen standard
  - (See also, on the choice of a standard, in \sect[[section_12][12]])
*** <<section_11>>11. Equations of Production
- So, with these additional assumptions, the equations take the form:
  #+begin_verse
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{a}w/ = /Ap_{a}/
  (/A_{b}p_{a}/ + /B_{b}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{b}w/ = /Bp_{b}/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  (/A_{k}p_{a}/ + /B_{k}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{k}w/ = /Kp_{k}/
  #+end_verse
- We assume, as before, the system is in a self-replacing state, so
  /A_{a}+A_{b}+...+A_{k}\le A/, /B_{a}/ + /B_{b}/ + ... + /B_{k}/ \le
  /B/, etc.
*** <<section_12>>12. National Income in a Self-Replacing System
- *Definition.* The *National Income* of a system in a self-replacing
  state consists of the set of commodities which are "left over" after
  the articles replacing the means of production are used up.
  - In other words, if we denote /\Delta A/ = /A/ - (/A_{a}/ + /A_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}/)
    and so on for all other industries, we have /(\Delta A)p_{a}/ + /(\Delta
    B)p_{b}/ + ... + /(\Delta K)p_{k}/ be the national income.
- *Convention (Value of National Income Set to Unity).*
  The value of this set of commodities, or "composite commodities" as it
  may be called, which forms the national income...we set to 1.
  - Thus the national income becomes the standard in terms of which the
    wage and /k/ prices are expressed (taking the place of the arbitrarily
    chosen single commodity in terms of which the /k/ - 1 prices, besides
    the wage, were expressed).
  - We have the additional equation:
    #+begin_verse
    (/\Delta A/) /p_{a}/ + (/\Delta B/) /p_{b}/ + ... + (/\Delta K/) /p_{k}/ = 1.
    #+end_verse
  - It is impossible for the aggregate quantity of any commodity
    represented in this expression to be negative, otherwise we contradict
    the assumption the economy is in a self-replacing state!
  - This gives /k/ + 1 equations as compared to /k/ + 2 variables (the /k/
    prices, the wage /w/, and the rate of profits /r/).
  - The result of adding the wage as one of the variables is that the
    number of these now exceeds the number of equations by one. The system
    has "one degree of freedom". If one of the variables is fixed, the
    others will be too.
** Ch. 3. Proportions of Labor to Means of Production
 *CAUTION:* This entire section appears to be completely abstract
reasoning, without manipulating a model at hand. Proceed /very slowly!/
*** <<section_13>>13. Wages as a Proportion of National Income
- We now give the wage /w/ successive values ranging from 1 to 0: these
  represent fractions of the national income
  (compare \sect[[section_10][10]] and \sect[[section_12][12]]).
- Objective: determine how changes in the wage affects the rate of
  profits, and the prices of individual commodities...assuming the
  methods of production remain unchanged.  
*** <<section_14>>14. Values when whole National Income goes to Wages
- When we make /w/ = 1, the whole national income goes to wages
  and /r/ is eliminated.
- We thus revert to the systems of equations we /began/ with! The
  difference being the quantities of labor are now shown explicitly
  instead of being represented by quantities of necessaries for
  subsistence. 
- The relative values of commodities are in proportion to their labor
  cost, i.e. the quantity of labor which directly and indirectly gone to
  produce them. (See [[appendix_a][Appendix "On Sub-Systems"]])
- Sraffa asserts "at no other wage-level do values follow a simple
  rule".
  - Question: This is fairly cryptic. Does he mean values will not be in
    proportion to the quantity of labor which directly and indirectly
    produce the commodities? Or does he mean something else? 
  - Answer: What Sraffa means, I believe, is that at no other wage level
    do we recover the first sort of model we discussed...instead we
    recover a system where the "relative values of commodities" are not
    in direct proportion to their labor costs.
  - *Remark.* It seems this proposition has some bearing on the labor
    theory of value, although not in the "obvious way"...
*** <<section_15>>15. Variety in the proportions of labor to Means of Production
- Consider the situation when the wages are reduced (i.e., we don't
  allocate the national product as wage): a rate of profits
  will emerge.
- How do "relative prices" react to changes in wage?
- The key lies in the inequality of the proportions in which labor and
  the means of production are used in the various industries.
  - *Remark.* This phrasing seems ambiguous to me. What exactly is the
    "proportion" Sraffa speaks of? Isn't it apples and oranges? Or does he
    mean the ratio of "the value of the means of production" to the wage?
    
    It seems, based on reading further text, Sraffa refers to the ratio
    of the "value of the means of production" to the wage...well, I
    /think/ he means wage (or else it could be the "value of the labor"). 
    
    Sraffa is motivating his "Standard commodity" (the subject of the
    next chapter!). The ratio, for the moment, is of values...but later
    we will see it doesn't matter if we use values or actual
    commodities. Yes it is "apples and oranges", but Sraffa's genius
    works this out! 
- If the proportion were the same in all industries, no price-changes
  could ensue regardless of any diversity of the commodity-composition
  of the means of production in different industries.
- For in each industry, an equal deduction from the wage would yield
  just as much as required for paying profits on its means of production
  at a uniform rate without disturbing existing prices.
  - In these "proportions", the means of production must be measured by
    their values. But since values may change with a change in the wage,
    the question emerges: which values?
  - The answer is---as regards establishing the equality or inequality
    of the proportions (that's all we're concerned with at the
    moment)---all possible sets of values give the same result.
  - In effect, as we have seen, if the proportions of all the industries
    are equal, then values (and therefore proportions) do not change
    with the wage.
  - From this it follows if the proportions are unequal at the set of
    values corresponding to one wage, they cannot be equal at any other,
    and so they are unequal at all values.
*** <<section_16>>16. "Deficit-Industries" and "Surplus-Industries"
- For the same reason, it is impossible for prices to remain unchanged
  when there is inequality of "proportions".
- Suppose prices /did/ remain unchanged when the wage was reduced and a
  rate of profits emerged.
  - Since in any one industry
    
    1. what was saved through the wage-reduction would depend on the number of men employed, while
    2. what was necessary for paying profits at a uniform rate would depend on the aggregate value of the means of production used,
    
    Industries with a sufficiently low proportion of labor to means of
    production would have a deficit...while industries with a sufficiently high
    proportion would have a *surplus*, on their payments for wages and profits.
  - Nothing is assumed at the moment as to what rate of profits
    correspond to what wage reduction. All we require at this stage is
    there should be a uniform wage and a uniform rate of profits
    throughout the system.
*** <<section_17>>17. A Watershed Proportion
- There would be a "critical proportion" of labor to means of production
  which marked the watershed between "deficit" and "surplus" industries.
- An industry with such a proportion would show an *even balance*---the
  proceeds of the wage-reduction would provide *exactly* what was
  required for the payment of profits at the general rate.
- Whatever the precise value of that "proportion" in any system, it can
  be said /a priori/ that---in a system with two or more basic
  industries---the industry with the lowest proportion of labor to means
  of production would be a "deficit" industry and the one with the
  highest proportion would be a "surplus" industry.
*** <<section_18>>18. Price-Changes to Redress Balance
- Thus with a wage-reduction, price-changes would +be called for+ necessary to
  redress the balance in each of the "deficit" and "surplus" industries.
- We expect the price-ratio between each product and its means of
  production "to come into play".
  - Consider the "deficit" industry when wage is reduced. A rise in the
    price of the produce relatively to the means of production would
    help to eliminate the deficit, since it would release some of that
    share of the gross product into the industry which had been going to
    pay for the replacement of the (now cheapened) means of production.
    
    This would be added to the quantity available for the distribution
    as wages or profits.
    
    The price rise by itself would thus result in an increase in the
    magnitude (and "not merely in the value") of that part of the
    product of the industry which is available for distribution, despite
    the methods of production remaining unchanged.
- A further effect of the rise in the price of the product (relative
  to the means of production) would be to help a given quantity of
  product to go a "longer way" towards achieving the required rate of
  profit.
- Independent of this, the steeper the rise in the product's price
  relative to labor, the smaller the quantity of it absorbed by the wage.
- Conversely, price-movements in the opposite direction would accomplish
  the disposal of the surplus which otherwise would appear in an
  industry using a high "proportion" of labor to the means of production.
*** <<section_19>>19. Price-Ratios of Product to Means of Production
- It does not follow that the price of the product of an industry
  having a low proportion of labor to means of production (and hence a
  "potential deficit") would necessarily rise, with a wage-reduction,
  relative to its own means of production. 
  
  "On the contrary," Sraffa writes, "it might possibly fall." The reason
  for this seeming contradiction: the means of production for an
  industry are themselves the product of one or more industries which
  (in turn)
  may employ a still lower proportion of labor to the means of
  production (and the same may be said for these commodities' means of
  production; etc.)
  
  In this case, the price of the product --- although produced by a
  "deficit" industry --- might *fall* in terms of its means of
  production. Its deficiency would have to be made good through a
  particularly steep rise relative to labor.
- Result: as wages fall, the price of the product for a low-proportion
  ("deficit") industry may rise or fall, or even alternate in rising and
  falling, relative to its means of production...while the price of
  the product of a high-proportion ("surplus") industry may fall or
  rise, or alternate. What neither can do, as we will see in
  \sect\sect[[section_21][21]]--[[section_21][22]], is remain stable in price relative to its
  means of production throughout any range (long or short) of the
  wage-variation. 
*** <<section_20>>20. Price-Ratios between Products
- These considerations dominate the price-relation of a product to its
  means of production *and* equally to its relations to any other product.
- It's the "proportions" of labor to means of production which
  determines the relative "price" between commodities. NB: this is
  iterative, so those means of production used up are subject to the
  same method determining its "relative price".
- The net result and justification for price-variations from a change in
  distribution remains a simple one: redressing the balance in each industry.
*** <<section_21>>21. A Recurrent Proportion
- We can now revert to the "critical proportion" (mentioned in
  \sect[[section_17][17]]) as the border between "deficit" industries and "surplus"
  ones.
- *Assumption.*
  Suppose we had an industry sector with that "critical proportion" of
  means of production to labor, and moreover each sector (producing each
  commodity used as a means of production) are themselves in this
  "critical proportion" state...and all the sectors involved in
  producing the means of production used in the production of the means
  of production are in that critical state, and so on.
- The commodity produced in such a sector would have its value not be
  affected when wages rose or fell. This can only happen from a
  potential deficit or surplus...but we assumed the industry was "in balance"!
  - NB: A commodity of this sort would not change its value relative to
    other commodities.
- Two separate conditions have been assumed to attain this result:
  1. The "balancing" proportion is used", and
  2. one and the same proportion /recurs/ in all successive layers of
     the industry's aggregate means of production without limit.
- Note the second condition /implies/ the first. This is the subject of
  the next section...
*** <<section_22>>22. Balancing Ratio and Maximum Rate of Profits
- It will be convenient to replace the "proportion" (quantity of labor
  to means of production) with one of the corresponding "pure" ratios
  between homogeneous quantities.
  - There are two such ratios: 
    1. the *quantity-ratio* of direct to indirect labor employed; and
    2. the *value-ratio* of net product to means of production.
  - These two ratios coincide when the value-ratio is calculated at the
    values for /w/ = 1.
  - Sraffa uses the latter ratio here.
- The rate of profits is uniform in all industries (and depends only on
  the wage), the value-ratio of the net product to the means of
  production is in general different for each industry and mainly
  depends on its particular circumstances of production.
- *Exception:* When we make the wage zero (i.e., /w/ = 0) and the whole
  net product goes to profits, in each industry the value-ratio of the
  net product to means of production necessarily comes to coincide with
  the general rate of profits /r/. At this level the "value ratios" of
  all industries are equal, regardless of how different the "value
  ratios" may have been at other wage-levels.
- The only "value-ratio" which /can/ be invariant to changes in wage (and
  thus capable of being "recurrent" in the sense defined in \sect[[section_21][21]])
  is the one equal to the rate of profits corresponding with
  zero wage. And /that/ is the "balancing" ratio.
- <<defn_max_rate_of_profits>>*Definition.* The "*Maximum Rate of Profits*" is the rate of profits
  as it would be if the whole national income went to profits, and we
  denote it by /R/.
** Ch. 4. The Standard Commodity
*** <<section_23>>23. "An invariable measure of value"
- So we chose some commodity which we took as our "yard stick" measuring
  value. But we have a problem: how do we measure the changes of value
  over time?
- *Problem.* If we express everything in its exchangeability expressed in eggs,
  what happens when the value of an egg changes?
- It becomes impossible to determine price-fluctuations...whether it
  emerges from the commodity or the particular "yard stick's" value
  changes.
  - The "relevant peculiarities" consists only in the inequality in the
    ratio of labor to means of production in the "successive layers"
    into which a commodity and the aggregate of its means of production
    can be analyzed. 
- The "balanced" commodity which we considered in \sect[[section_21][21]] would present
  no peculiarities we just discussed.
  - We admit that as wages fell, such a "balanced commodity" would be as
    susceptible to change in price (relative to other individual
    commodities) as anything else could. *BUT* we should know any such
    fluctuations would originate in the peculiarities of the production
    of the compared commodity...the change would *not* occur on its own.
  - *Remark.* What Sraffa suggests, in modern terms, would be that a
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Num%C3%A9raire][Numeraire]] exists.
*** <<section_24>>24. The perfect Composite Commodity
- It's doubtful any /single/ commodity posses the desired properties.
- A *mixture* of commodities, or a "composite commodity", i.e. a linear
  combination of commodities, would do equally well...or even better,
  since it could be "blended" (the coefficients picked) to suit our needs.
  - Economists use the term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_basket][Basket]] instead of "composite commodity".
- The mixture of commodities needs to consists of the same commodities
  as its aggregate means of production...i.e., if we take our
  concoction, then substitute for each commodity its inputs (means of
  productions), then we should have our concoction remain invariant.
  - NB: This is a symmetry condition! One could apply representation
    theory, but that would be overkill...
- Sraffa asks: can such a commodity be constructed? (I'm going to guess "yes"...)
*** <<section_25>>25. Construction of such a commodity: example
- The problem really concerns industries rather than commodities...so we
  should approach it from that angle.
- Suppose we pick out a subspace (a "sub-economy" if you will) that forms
  a "complete miniature system" with some property. Specifically, we
  want its various commodities represented among its aggregate means of
  production in /the same proportions/ as they are among its products.
- Consider an example:
  #+begin_verse
  90 t iron + 120 t coal +  60 qr wheat + (3/16) labor \to 180 t iron
  50 t iron + 125 t coal + 150 qr wheat + (5/16) labor \to 450 t coal
  40 t iron +  40 t coal + 200 qr wheat + (8/16) labor \to 480 qr wheat
  #+end_verse
  Notice the columns sum to 180 t iron, 285 t coal, and 410 qr
  wheat...the labor sums to 1 as usual.
  - *Pop quiz:* What's the national income of this economy?
  - *Solution:* We see iron is completely self-replacing, but the other
    two sectors have surplus. Thus we see the surplus consists of 165 t
    coal and 70 qr wheat. This gives us the national income.
- How do we obtain a reduced-scale system?
  - We need to reduce the sectors with surplus. Note if we do this,
    without reducing the iron sector, then automatically the iron sector
    will have surplus!
  - We set up a system of equations, neglecting labor:
    #+begin_verse
    90 t + 120 c +  60 q \to 180 t
    /x/ (50 t + 125 c + 150 q)\to /x/ (450 c)
    /y/ (40 t +  40 c + 200 q)\to /y/ (480 q)
    #+end_verse
    where we are trying to find /x/ and /y/ such that the 
    ratio of the sum of the inputs to the outputs are the same (so the
    ratio of the sum of the iron inputs across all sectors to iron
    produced is the same as the coal inputs across all sectors to the
    coal produced). 
    
    So our system of equations may be derived from
    #+begin_verse
    (90 + /x/ 50 + /y/ 40)/180 = (120 + /x/ 125 + /y/ 40)/(/x/ 450)
                         = (60 + /x/ 150 + /y/ 200)/(/y/ 480)
    #+end_verse
    which works if and only if /x/ = 3/5, and /y/ = 3/4.
  - Thus our system becomes 
    #+begin_verse
    90 t iron + 120 t coal +  60 qr wheat + (3/16) labor \to 180 t iron
    30 t iron +  75 t coal +  90 qr wheat + (3/16) labor \to 270 t coal
    30 t iron +  30 t coal + 150 qr wheat + (6/16) labor \to 360 qr wheat
    #+end_verse
- The proportions which the three commodities are produced in the new
  system (180 : 270 : 360) are equal to the proportions which they enter
  its aggregate means of production (150 : 225 : 300). The composite
  commodity sought for is accordingly made up in the proportions
  #+begin_verse
  1 t. iron : 1.5 t. coal : 2 qr. wheat.
  #+end_verse
- *Remark.* Again, this seems familiar compared with, e.g., Marx's
  notion of the "total or expanded form of value" discussed in
  [[http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S3b][/Das Kapital/, Ch. 1, \sect 3]].
*** <<section_26>>26. Standard Commodity Defined
- *Definitions.* We shall call this sort of mixture the *Standard composite commodity*,
  or /Standard commodity/ for short. The set of equations taken in the
  proportions producing the standard commodity we call the *Standard system*.
- In any actual economic system, a miniature Standard system's embedded
  in it...which can be brought to light by "chipping off" the unwanted
  bits. (The same way a system not in a self-reproducing state can be
  transformed into a self-reproducing subsystem.)
- What do we take as the "unit" of the Standard commodity?
  - The quantity of the Standard commodity that would form the net
    product of a Standard system employing the whole annual labor of the system.
    
    That is to say, the output for a standard system when the labor
    column sums to 1.
  - In our example, the labor column sums to (12/16). We need to
    "enlarge" each sector by (1/3). As a result, the system becomes:
    #+begin_verse
    120 t iron + 160 t coal +  80 qr wheat + (1/4) labor \to 240 t iron
     40 t iron + 100 t coal + 120 qr wheat + (1/4) labor \to 360 t coal
     40 t iron +  40 t coal + 200 qr wheat + (2/4) labor \to 480 qr wheat
    #+end_verse
    Observe the surplus in this system is: 40 t iron, 60 t. coal, and 80
    qr. wheat. Thus --- insofar as I understand this --- 
    the unit would consist of 40 t. iron, 60 t. coal, and 80 qr. wheat.
- *Definition.* Such a unit we shall call the *Standard net product* or
    *Standard national income*.
*** <<section_27>>27. Equal Percentage Excess
- The rate which the quantity produced exceeds the quantity used up in
  production is the same in each sector for a Standard system. Why?
  Simple: in the Standard system the various commodities produced are in
  the same proportion as they enter the aggregate means of production.
- In our running example, the rate for each commodity is 20%. (You see,
  the surplus divided by the input for any commodity is 20%; 40 t. iron
  divided by 200 t. iron is 40/200=1/5=20%.)
- Observe for the surplus sectors, when we add the input together then
  multiply by 120%, we recover the output from the transformed system
  described in \sect[[section_25][25]].
*** <<section_28>>28. Standard Ratio (/R/) of Net Product to Means of Production
- *Definition.* The rate which applies to individual commodities *is* also the
  rate which the total product of the Standard system exceeds its
  aggregate means of production, i.e., the ratio of the net product to
  the means of production of the system.  This ratio we call the
  *Standard ratio*.
- Note we didn't say the ratio /of the values/ of the net product to the
  means of production! This is because both collections are made up in
  the same proportions---because they're quantities of the same
  composite commodity.
- So if we wrote the standard commodity as \sigma, for simplicity, then
  the ratio would be (/x/\sigma)/(/y/\sigma). If we used the values,
  then we modify \sigma\to\sigma', and the ratio remains the same.
  
  Hence the ratio of the values of the two aggregates would *inevitably*
  always be the ratio of the quantities of their components.
- In the Standard system, the ratio of the net product to means of
  production would remain the same...regardless of variations in the
  division of net product between wages and profits, and regardless of
  consequent price changes.
*** <<section_29>>29. Standard Ratio and Rates of Profits
- If we use a fraction of the net product instead, everything that has
  been stated holds...why? Because we are working with multiples of a
  composite commodity! So the ratio of such a fraction to the means of
  production will remain *unaffected* by any variations of prices.
- Suppose the Standard net product is divided between wages and profits
  (taking care that the share of each consists of Standard
  commodity). The resulting rate of profits would be in the same
  proportion to the Standard ratio of the system as allotted to profits
  was to the whole of the system.
- *Example.* Our running example given above, where the Standard ratio
  was 20%. If (3/4) of the Standard national income went to wages, and
  (1/4) to profits, then the rate of profits would be 5%...why? Because
  (1/4) of 20% is precisely 5%! If half went to each, the rate of
  profits would be 10%. And if the whole went to profit, the rate of
  profits would reach its maximum level of 20% and coincide with the
  Standard ratio.
  - *Exercise.* It seems difficult for me to grasp that this transformed
    matrix would produce, from this procedure, the desired
    eigenvalue. One should probably rigorously prove this...and by
    "one", I mean "I"...
- The rate of profits in the Standard system therefore appears as a
  ratio between quantities of commodities irrespective of their prices.
*** <<section_30>>30. Relation between wage and rate of profits in Standard System
- Let us re-capitulate what has been determined:
    
  If /R/ is the Standard ratio or Maximum rate of profits, and /w/ is
  the proportion of the net product that goes to wages, the rate of
  profit is
  #+begin_verse
  /r/ = /R/ (1 - /w/).
  #+end_verse
  Thus as wages gradually reduce from 1 to 0, the rate of profits
  increase /in direct proportion/. The relationship is a straight line
  plotted on the axes (/r/, /w/).
*** <<section_31>>31. Relation Extended to any system
- Now, here we should note we've been working with a very peculiar
  "Standard system"...but does our results hold for *any* arbitrary
  economic system? (C.f., my exercise in \sect[[section_29][29]].)
- The question is equivalent to determining whether the decisive role
  the Standard commodity plays lies in its
  1. being the constituent material of national income and of the means
     of production (which is unique to the Standard system); or
  2. in its supplying the medium in which wages are estimated?
  For the latter is a function which the appropriate Standard commodity
  can fulfill in any case, regardless whether the system in in Standard
  proportions or not.
- The second alternative /appears/ wrong. So lets look at it in some
  more detail...
  - In the Standard system, the wage is paid out in proportion to the
    Standard commodity. This draws its special significance from the fact
    the "left overs" from profit will be a quantity of the Standard
    commodity. Moreover, it will be similar in composition to the means of
    production.
  - The result: the rate of profits (being the ratio of two homogeneous
    quantities) can be *seen* to rise in direct proportion to any
    reduction in wages.
  - Consider an "actual system". When the equivalent of the same
    quantity of the Standard commodity has been paid for wages, there is
    no reason to believe the /value/ of what is left over for profits
    should stand in the same ratio to the value of the means of
    production...unlike the corresponding /quantities/ do in the Standard
    system.
- The actual system consists of the same basic equations as the Standard
  system...just in different proportions. Once the wage is given, the
  rate of profits is determined for both systems regardless of the
  proportions of the equations in either of them.
- Particular proportions (e.g., the Standard ones) may give transparency
  to a system, and render visible what was hidden...but they *cannot*
  change its mathematical properties.
  - *Remark.* I think what has happened with the Standard system: we
    took our equations of production, expressed it as a matrix, examined
    the "Basic (commodities) subspace", projected the matrix obtaining a
    submatrix, then obtained an equivalent matrix. We've determined
    various properties of this equivalent matrix. The conclusion Sraffa
    reaches: equivalent matrices have equivalent rates of profits.
- The straight-line relation between wage and rate of profits therefore
  hold in all cases...provided *only* the wage is expressed in terms of
  the Standard product.
  - The same rate of profits (which in the Standard system is obtained
    as a ratio between /quantities/ of commodities) will in the actual
    system result from the ratio of aggregate values.
*** <<section_32>>32. Example
- Working with our running example, if in the actual system (as outlined
  in \sect[[section_25][25]], with /R/ = 20%) the wage is fixed in terms of the Standard net
  product, to /w/ = 3/4 there will correspond /r/ = 5%.
- While the share of wages will be 3/4 of the Standard national income,
  it /does not/ follow the share of profits will be the remaining 1/4 of
  the Standard income.
  - The share of profits will consist of whatever is left of the /actual/
    national income after deducting from it the equivalent 3/4 of the
    /Standard/ national income for wages.
- Prices must be such as to make the value of what goes to profits equal
  to 5% of the value of the actual means of production.
*** <<section_33>>33. Construction of the Standard commodity: the /q/-system
- *Problem.* Constructing a Standard commodity amounts to finding a set
  of /k/ suitable multipliers, which Sraffa calls /q_{a}/, /q_{b}/, ...,
  /q_{k}/, applied respectively to the production equations of
  commodities 'a', 'b', ..., 'k'.
  
  These multipliers must be such that the resulting quantities of the
  various commodities will bear the same proportions to one another on
  the right hand side of the equations (as products) as they do on the
  aggregate left-hand side (as means of production)
  - In other words, after dilating both sides by these multipliers, the
    ratio of the sum of the /a^{th}/ column to the output /q_{a}A/ is
    the same as the sum of the /b^{th}/ column to the output /q_{b}B/,
    or any other such ratio.
- *Definition.* This implies the percentage which the output of a
  commodity exceeds the quantity of it entering the aggregate means of
  production is the same for all commodities. This percentage we have
  called the "*Standard ratio*" and we have denoted it by the letter /R/.
- As good mathematicians know, such properties take the form of
  equations. What's our equations?
  
  We have a system of equations, *arranged in a different order* which
  looks like: 

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  (/A_{a}q_{a}/ + /A_{b}q_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}q_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Aq_{a}/
  (/B_{a}q_{a}/ + /B_{b}q_{b}/ + ... + /B_{k}q_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Bq_{a}/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  (/K_{a}q_{a}/ + /K_{b}q_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}q_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Kq_{a}/
  #+END_VERSE

  This system of equations Sraffa calls the "*/q/-System*".
  - *Remark.* Observe the left hand side of each equation is the
    aggregate input, suitably dilated. The right hand side is the
    dilated output.
  - *Remark.* This system is under-determined, since there are /k/
    multipliers and /R/...but only /k/ equations.
- To make sure the /q/-equations have a unique solution, we need to add
  an additional equation specifying the labor in each sector (suitably
  dilated) adds up to unity:

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  /L_{a}q_{a}/ + /L_{b}q_{b}/ + ... + /L_{k}q_{k}/ = 1.
  #+END_VERSE

  This gives us /k/ + 1 independent equations determining the /k/
  multipliers and /R/.

*** <<section_34>>34. Standard national income as unit
- Suppose we solve our /q/ system of equations.
  - *Notation:* Sraffa refers to the solutions as /q'_{a}/, /q'_{b}/,
    ..., /q'_{k}/ --- primed /q/'s refer to the particular fixed solutions.
- We apply these equations to the equations of production system
  \sect[[section_11][11]], and thus transform it into a Standard system as follows:

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  /q'_{a}/ [(/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + (/L_{a}w/)] = /q'_{a}Ap_{a}/
  /q'_{b}/ [(/A_{b}p_{a}/ + /B_{b}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + (/L_{a}w/)] = /q'_{b}Bp_{b}/
   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  /q'_{k}/ [(/A_{k}p_{a}/ + /B_{k}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + (/L_{a}w/)] = /q'_{k}Kp_{k}/
  #+END_VERSE

- From this, we derive the Standard national income which we adopt as
  the unit of wages and prices in the original system of production.
- The unit equation of \sect[[section_12][12]] is therefore replaced by the following
  (where the /q/'s stand for known numbers, since they're primed, and the
  /p/'s are the unknowns):

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  [(/q'_{a}A/) - (/q'_{a}A_{a}/ + ... + /q'_{k}A_{k}/)] /p_{a}/
  + [(/q'_{b}B/) - (/q'_{a}B_{a}/ + ... + /q'_{k}B_{k}/)] /p_{b}/
  + ...
  + [(/q'_{k}K/) - (/q'_{a}K_{a}/ + ... + /q'_{k}K_{k}/)] /p_{k}/
  = 1
  #+END_VERSE

- The composite commodity given by this unit equation (\Delta /A/ +
  ... + \Delta /K/) is the Standard of wages and prices we have been
  seeking since \sect[[section_23][23]].
*** <<section_35>>35. Non-Basics excluded
- We excluded non-basic products from the system, so it's 
  impossible they could influence...anything. The multiplier
  appropriate for their equations can only be zero.
  - The same is true for non-basics which, while not entering the means
    of production for commodities in general, but are used in producing
    non-basics...including themselves (e.g., special raw materials for
    luxury goods; luxury animals reproduce themselves; etc.).
  - Insofar as a commodity of this kind entered the production of
    non-basic products of this type, it follows the latter's fate having
    zero for its multiplier.
  - NB: the ratio of its quantity as a product to its quantity as means
    of production would be exclusively determined through its own
    production equation. Therefore it would in general be unrelated to /R/
    and be incompatible with the Standard system.
    
    The multiplier appropriate to it would therefore also be zero. 
  - Sraffa has a footnote stating: "Strictly speaking the multiplier
    would be zero for every possible value of /R/ except the one that was
    equal to the ratio of the quantity of that non-basic in the net
    product to its quantity in the means of production. This is a freak
    case of the type referred to in Appendix B: at that particular value
    of /R/ all prices would be zero in terms of the non-basic in
    question."
- We may simplify the discussion by assuming all non-basic equations are
  eliminated at the outset so only basic industries come under
  consideration.
- NB: the absence of non-basic industries from the Standard system does
  not prevent the latter from being equivalent in its effects to the
  original system since (as we have seen in \sect[[section_6][6]]) their presence or
  absence makes no difference to the determination of prices and of the
  rate of profits. 

** Ch. 5. Uniqueness of the Standard System
*** <<section_36>>36. Introductory
- Sraffa will prove there exists precisely one way to transform a given
  economic system into a Standard system. 
*** <<section_37>>37. Transformation into a Standard system always possible
- We may show this using an "imaginary experiment" (Sraffa's term for a
  "thought experiment"?).
- *Algorithm.* We can generate the standard system constructively. It involves two types of alternating steps:
  (1) Changing the proportions of the industries; (2) Reducing the same ratio the quantities produced by all industries, while leaving unchanged the quantities used as means of production.
  - *Step 1.* We adjust the proportions of all industries in our system such that:
    every basic commodity produces more than strictly necessary for
    replacement. (I.e., every basic commodity has surplus.)
    - Is this always possible mathematically? Well, yes, that was what
      \sect[[section_25][25]] was all about!
    - NB: this step is ambiguous, or more precisely allows some freedom
      in picking /how/ we adjust the proportions. Unfortunately, this
      freedom spoils the proof as an algorithm we could naively
      implement on the computer, but can be remedied by picking some
      arbitrary scheme.
  - *Step 2.* 
    Suppose we gradually reduce the product of all industries, slowly and
    successively in small steps...but without interfering with the
    quantities of labor and means of production they employ.
    - I honestly don't see how this is done. We decrease the output
      without changing the input?
    - If we examine \sect[[section_26][26]], we see an example of this "enlarging process".
  - *Step 3.* If the products have been reduced to such an extent that
    all-round replacement is just possible without leaving anything as
    surplus, we terminate the algorithm. Otherwise, we go back to step 1.
  - *Output.* The proportions attained by the industries are the
    proportions of the Standard system.
- With increasing the quantity produced in each sector by a uniform
  rate, we are able to restore the original conditions. We do not
  disturb the proportions to which the industries have been
  brought. The uniform rate restoring the original conditions of
  production is /R/, and the proportions attained by the industries are
  the Standard proportions!
*** <<section_38>>38. Why question of uniqueness arises
- Is the Standard system unique, or are there other ways to get the same result?
- The equations of the /q/-system \sect[[section_33][33]] are reducible to an equation
  of the /k/-th degree in /R/. The [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremofAlgebra.html][fundamental theorem of algebra]] tells
  us there are at most /k/ different solutions!
- It is sufficient to prove there cannot be more than one value of /R/
  which corresponds to an all-positive set of /q/'s. This implies
  [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UniquenessTheorem.html][uniqueness]] of the Standard System.
*** <<section_39>>39. Prices Positive at all wage levels
- First, we must show -- as there always exists a possible set of
  multipliers (\sect[[section_37][37]]) -- there exists at all values of wage (including
  zero) a set of prices satisfying the condition of replacement of the
  means of production with uniform profits. I.e., there exists a set of
  /positive/ values of /p/'s.
- We consider /w/ = 1 where, since prices equal labor costs (\sect[[section_14][14]]),
  the values of the /p/'s must necessarily all be positive.
  - If the value of /w/ is moved continuously from 1 to 0, the values of
    the /p/'s will also move continuously...so any /p/ that becomes
    negative *must* pass through 0.
  - However, while wages and profits are positive, the price of no
    commodity can become 0 until the price of at least one of the other
    commodities entering its means of production becomes negative.
  - Thus, since no /p/ can become negative before any other, none can
    become negative at all.
  - *Footnote.* For this proof to be complete, we must show that the
    /p/'s representing prices of basic products cannot become negative
    through becoming infinite---unlike the /p/'s of non-basics which can
    do so. Sraffa shows this in "Note on Self-reproducing Non-basics"
    (Appendix B).
*** <<section_40>>40. Production equations with zero wages
- For comparison purposes, we rewrite here the production equations as
  they appear when wages vanish (i.e., when /w/ = 0).
- The labor terms may be omitted (since we multiply them with 0), and we
  use the maximum rate of profits /R/ for /r/.
- We can take the price of any one of the commodities as unity.
- The production system becomes
  #+begin_verse
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Ap_{a}/
  (/A_{b}p_{a}/ + /B_{b}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Bp_{b}/
  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
  (/A_{k}p_{a}/ + /B_{k}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p_{k}/)(1 + /R/) = /Kp_{k}/
  #+end_verse
*** <<section_41>>41. Unique set of positive multipliers
We can show now there can be no more than one set of positive
multipliers! We will enumerate the steps in Sraffa's proof...

1. Let /R'_{}/ be a possible value of /R/ to which there correspond
   *positive* prices /p'_{a}/, /p'_{b}/, ..., /p'_{k}/ and *positive*
   multipliers /q'_{a}/, /q'_{b}/, ..., /q'_{k}/. 
   
   Let /R''_{}/ be another possible value of /R/ with corresponding
   prices /p''_{a}/, ..., /p''_{k}/ and multipliers /q''_{a}/, ...,
   /q''_{k}/. 
   
   We must prove it is impossible for the /q"_{}/'s to all be positive.
2. Consider the production equations (with /w/ = 0), using /R'_{}/ for
   /R/, and /p'_{a}/, ..., /p'_{k}/ for /p_{a}/, ..., /p_{k}/. Then
   multiply the /p'_{}/'s respectively by /q''_{a}/, ..., /q''_{k}/. We obtain
   #+begin_verse
   /q''_{a}/ (/A_{a}p'_{a}/ + /B_{a}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p'_{k}/)(1 + /R'_{}/) = /q''_{a}Ap'_{a}/
   /q''_{b}/ (/A_{b}p'_{a}/ + /B_{b}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p'_{k}/)(1 + /R'_{}/) = /q''_{b}Bp'_{b}/
   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
   /q''_{k}/ (/A_{k}p'_{a}/ + /B_{k}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p'_{k}/)(1 + /R'_{}/) = /q''_{k}Kp'_{k}/
   #+end_verse
3. Add all the equations in our system (from step 2) together:
   #+begin_verse
   [ /q''_{a}/ (/A_{a}p'_{a}/ + /B_{a}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p'_{k}/)
     + /q''_{b}/ (/A_{b}p'_{a}/ + /B_{b}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{b}p'_{k}/)
     + ...
     + /q''_{k}/ (/A_{k}p'_{a}/ + /B_{k}p'_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}p'_{k}/)](1 + /R'_{}/)
    = (/q''_{a}Ap'_{a}/ + /q''_{b}Bp'_{b}/ + ... + /q''_{k}Kp'_{k}/)
   #+end_verse
4. Now, if we work with the /q/-equations (as given in \sect[[section_30][30]]) taking
   /R''_{}/ for /R/ and /q''_{a}/, ..., /q''_{k}/ for /q_{a}/, ...,
   /q_{k}/; then multiplying them respectively by /p'_{a}/, ...,
   /p'_{k}/, we obtain
   #+begin_verse
   /p'_{a}/ (/A_{a}q''_{a}/ + /A_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}q''_{k}/)(1 + /R"_{}/) = /p'_{a}Aq"_{a}/
   /p'_{b}/ (/B_{a}q''_{a}/ + /B_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /B_{k}q''_{k}/)(1 + /R"_{}/) = /p'_{b}Bq"_{b}/
   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
   /p'_{k}/ (/K_{a}q''_{a}/ + /K_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}q''_{k}/)(1 + /R"_{}/) = /p'_{k}Kq"_{k}/
   #+end_verse
5. We add up all the equations in step 4 to get the equation
   #+begin_verse
   [ /p'_{a}/ (/A_{a}q''_{a}/ + /A_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /A_{k}q''_{k}/)
     + /p'_{b}/ (/B_{a}q''_{a}/ + /B_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /B_{k}q''_{k}/)
     + ...
     + /p'_{k}/ (/K_{a}q''_{a}/ + /K_{b}q''_{b}/ + ... + /K_{k}q''_{k}/)](1 + /R"_{}/) 
   = /p'_{a}Aq"_{a}/ + /p'_{b}Bq"_{b}/ + ... + /p'_{k}Kq"_{k}/
   #+end_verse
6. The terms in the equation from step 1 are identical with those of the
   equation in step 2, despite grouped differently. The only exception?
   We have /R'_{}/ in one, and /R"_{}/ in the other.
   
   Thus for the equations to be true, both sides of both equations must
   be equal to zero: which (since all the /p/'s are positive) implies
   some of the /q"_{}/'s must be negative.
   - This prove *if* there exists a set of positive values for the
     /p/'s, then there can be no more than one set of positive values
     for the /q/'s.
   - *Footnote.* Sraffa notes a similar argument, only putting in the
     /p"_{}/'s and the /q'_{}/'s instead of the /p'_{}/'s and the
     /q"_{}/'s proves: if there exists a set of positive values for
     the /q/'s, then there can be no more than one set of positive values for
     the /p/'s.
7. We had previously seen (in \sect[[section_37][37]]) there always exists a set of
   positive /q/'s and (in \sect[[section_39][39]]) there always exists a set of positive
   /p/'s. We can therefore conclude there exists always one and only one
   value of /R/ and a corresponding set of positive multipliers (/q/'s)
   which transform a given economic system into a Standard system.
*** <<section_42>>42. Positive multipliers correspond to /lowest/ value of /R/
- We can show a corollary: the value of /R/ which corresponds to
  all-positive prices (which we shall call /R'_{}/) is the *lowest* of
  the /k/ possible values of /R/.
- We assume for contradiction this is not true. Then there exists a
  value of /R/ *lower* than /R'_{}/ which we shall call /R"_{}/. As an
  example, make /R'_{}/ = 15% and /R"_{}/ = 10%.
- To determine if this is possible, we revert to the system with /w/ and
  /r/ (\sect[[section_11][11]]). We assign as wage a quantity of the Standard commodity,
  which corresponds to /R'_{}/. Thus we replace the labor terms
  (/L_{a}w/, /L_{b}w/, etc.) with proportionate quantities of the
  Standard commodity, such that their total is a fraction of the
  Standard national income:
\begin{equation}
1-\frac{R''}{R'}
\end{equation}
- (In the example we have chosen, this would be 1/3).
- At the same time we take as standard of prices an arbitrarily chosen
  basic commodity /a/ and make its value equal to unity (i.e., /p_{a}/ = 1).
- Consider two sets of solutions for the resulting system. One
  corresponds to /R'_{}/ giving us
  #+begin_verse
  /r/ = /R'_{}/ [1-(1/3)] = 10%
  #+end_verse
  and /all-positive prices/ (since -- being positive at /r/ = /R'_{}/ --
  they will always be positive for all values of /r/ \ge 0; c.f. \sect[[section_39][39]]).
- The second set of solutions corresponds to /R"_{}/. We know from the
  last section, when prices correspond to /R"_{}/, the value of the
  Standard commodity (formed in proportions correspond to /R'_{}/) is
  zero. So wages vanish and
  #+begin_verse
  /r/ = /R"_{}/ = 10%.
  #+end_verse
  This implies among the prices corresponding to /R"_{}/ *some must be negative and others positive.*
- The two sets thus give the same value (10%) for /r/ but two different
  sets of prices.
- But this is impossible: given any single value for /r/, there exists
  only one corresponding set of prices. In effect, when /r/ is replaced
  by a known number (e.g., 10%) the equations form a linear system and
  for the remaining unknowns there exists a unique set of solutions.
  - *Footnote.* In these conditions, one of the equations is implicit in
    the others (see \sect[[section_3][3]], last paragraph) and the number (/k/ - 1) of
    independent equations is equal to the number of the remaining unknowns.
- Thus /R'_{}/ (the value of /R/ which corresponds to all-positive
  prices) cannot be higher -- and hence must be lower -- than any other
  value /R"_{}/ which corresponds to some positive and some negative prices.
  - *Footnote.* It may be noted the straight line relation represented
    by
    #+begin_quote
    /r/ = /R/ (1 - /w/)
    #+end_quote
    would continue to hold if wage were measured in any of the other
    Standard commodities which correspond to the possible values of /R/
    higher than /R'_{}/ (if it is possible to conceive of Standard
    commodities which include negative components; Sraffa addresses this in
    Ch. 8).
    
    The prices for various Standard commodities (relative to each other)
    would with change of /r/ move such that -- although wage would
    represent different proportions of the respective Standard national
    incomes -- these different fractions of different Standard incomes would
    all be of equal value.
    
    When /r/ was made equal to /R'_{}/ the wage in terms of any one of
    the Standard commodities would consist of a nonzero quantity of such
    Standard commodity...but the value of the latter would be zero if
    expressed in terms of the Standard commodity formed by means of
    all-positive multipliers and which corresponds to /R'_{}/.

*** <<section_43>>43. Standard product replace by equivalent quantity of labor
- The Standard commodity has been a purely auxiliary construction. We
  can present the essential element of the mechanism without having to
  resort to the Standard commodity.
- What do we know? If we make the Standard net product equal to unity
  (i.e., set it to 1), so we measure wage in terms of it, then a
  relation of proportionality is established between "wage deductions"
  and "enlarging the rate of profits" (quotes added to indicate the
  two quantities). Its in accordance with the expression 
  
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  /r/ = /R'_{}/ (1 - /w/)
  #+END_VERSE
  
  where /R'_{}/ is the ratio of the Standard net product to its means of
  production, which results from the /q/ equations.
- The proportion is reversible.
- If we make it a condition of the system that /w/ and /r/ should obey this
  sort of rule, the wage and commodity prices are then consequently
  expressed in Standard net product...without need of defining its
  composition (since no other unit can fulfill the rule)!
- How to do this? We have to substitute for the equation making Standard
  net product equal to unity (in \sect[[section_34][34]]), the relation linking /w/ and /r/ with
  /R'_{}/.
  - To find /R'_{}/ (i.e., the value of /R/ corresponding to positive
    multiplier and prices) we don't have to solve the /q/-equations. We can
    find it as the Maximum rate of profits from the previous equations, by
    making /w/ = 0.
  - Sraffa capitalizes "Maximum" in "Maximum rate of profit" here,
    though I don't know if it's significant or a typo.
- This condition is sufficient to ensure wage and commodity-prices are
  expressed in terms of the Standard net product. (Sraffa notes how
  amazing it is we can use a standard without knowing what it consists of).
- There exists a more tangible measure for prices of commodities, making
  it possible to displace the Standard net product. The measure is "the
  quantity of labor which can be purchased by the Standard net product."
  - As soon as we have fixed the rate of profits, without knowing the
    prices of commodity (nor needing to), a parity is established between
    the Standard net product and a quantity of labor which depends only on
    the rate of profits.
  - The resulting prices of commodities can be indifferently regarded as
    expressed in either (a) the Standard net product, or (b) the quantity
    of labor --- which at the given rate of profits --- is known to be
    equivalent to it.
  - This quantity of labor will inversely vary with the Standard wage
    (/w/) and directly with the rate of profits.
  - If the annual labor of this system is taken as unit, this equivalent
    quantity of labor (derived from the relation above) is
    \begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{w} = \frac{R'}{R' - r}
    \end{equation}
- All the properties for "an invariant standard of value" (as described
  in \sect[[section_23][23]]) are found in the variable quantity of labor, which varies
  according to a simple rule independent of prices: this unit of
  measurement increases in magnitude with the fall of the wage,
  i.e. with the rise of the rate of profits. It varies from (a)
  equaling the annual labor of the system when the rate of profits
  vanish, to (b) without limit as the rate of profits approaches its
  maximum value /R'_{}/.
- The remaining use of the Standard net product is as the medium which
  wage is expressed. Sraffa notes in this case "there seems to be no way
  of replacing it."
  - If we wish to eliminate it altogether, we must cease to regard /w/ as
    an expression for wage and treat is as a pure number which helps
    define the quantity of labor which constitutes the unit of prices at
    the given rate of profits.
  - Then the prices of commodities being expressed in terms of such
    quantity of labor, we can find its wage in terms of any commodity
    through taking the reciprocal of the price for that commodity.
*** <<section_44>>44. Wage or rate of profits as independent variable
- The last steps of the preceding argument led us to reverse the
  practice followed from the outset: treating the wage rater than the
  rate of profits as the independent variable (or "given" quantity).
- The choice of wage as independent variable was due to its being there
  as consisting of specified necessaries independent of prices or rate
  of profits.
- As soon as the possibility of variations in the division of product is
  admitted, this consideration loses its force.
- When wage is regarded as "given" in terms of a more-or-less abstract
  standard --- and does not acquire definite meaning until prices of
  commodities are determined --- the position is reversed.
  - The rate of profits (as a ratio) has a significance which is
    independent of any prices, and can well be "given" before prices are
    fixed.
  - It is accordingly susceptible of being determined from outside the
    system of production, in particular by the level of money rates of
    interest.
- *Convention.* The following sections will treat the rate of profits as
  the independent variable.
** Ch. 6. Reduction to Dated Labor
*** <<section_45>>45. Cost of production aspect
- Sraffa considers prices from their "cost of production" aspect, and
  examines the way they "resolve themselves" into wages and profits.
- Sraffa would have introduced the argument earlier "had it not been for
  the necessity of following one line of argument at a time".
*** <<section_46>>46. "Reduction" defined
- *Definition.* We call "Reduction to Dated Quantities of Labor" (or
  "/Reduction/" for short) an operation where the equation for a
  commodity, the different means of production used are replaced with
  a series of quantities of labor, each with its appropriate "date".
- Consider the equation representing the production for commodity
  '/a/' (where wage and prices are expressed in terms of the Standard
    commodity):
  #+begin_quote
  (/A_{a}p_{a}/ + /B_{a}p_{b}/ + ... + /K_{a}p_{k}/)(1 + /r/) + /L_{a}w/ = /Ap_{a}/
  #+end_quote
  - We start with replacing the commodities forming the means of
    production for /A/ with *their own* means of production and
    quantities of Labor. 

    In other words: we replace them with the commodities and labor which
    (as appears from their own respective equations) must be employed to
    reproduce those means of production; and they, having been expended
    a year earlier (\sect[[section_9][9]]), will be multiplied by a profit factor at a
    compound rate for the appropriate period...namely, the means of
    production by (1 + /r/)^{2} and labor by (1 + /r/).
  - It may be noted that /A_{a}/ --- the quantity of commodity /a/
    itself used in the production of /A/ --- is to be treated like any
    other means of production...i.e., replaced by its own means of
    production and labor.
  - *Remark.* Here we are "almost dynamic" but "still quite static"! We
    are taking into account time, kind of, but we are really...not.
- We next replace *these latter* means of production with their own
  means of production and labor, and to these will be applied a profit
  factor for one more year. Or to the means of production (1 +
  /r/)^{3} and to the labor (1 + /r/)^{2}.
- We can carry this operation on as far as we like. If next to the
  direct labor /L_{a}/ we place the successive aggregate quantities of
  labor which we collect at each step and we call respectively
  /L_{a(1)}/, /L_{a(2)}/, ..., /L_{a(n)}/, ..., we shall obtain the
  "*Reduction Equation*" for the product in the form of an infinite
    series
  #+begin_quote
  /L_{a}w/ + /L_{a(1)}w/ (1 + /r/) + ... + /L_{a(n)}w/ (1 + /r/)^{n} + ... = /Ap_{a}/.
  #+end_quote
- How far reduction needs to be pushed in order to obtain a given degree
  of approximation depends on the level of the rate of profits: the
  nearer the latter is to its maximum, the further must the reduction be
  carried.
- Beside the labor terms, there will always be a "commodity residue"
  consisting of minute fractions of every basic production; but it is
  always possible, by carrying the reduction sufficiently far, to render
  the residue so small as to have a negligible effect on price (at any
  prefixed rate of profits short of /R/).
  - *Remark.* I object to this supposition. If we carry this operation
    "infinitely far back", then we carry it back to a time predating
    humans. From a strictly historical perspective, humans began with
    labor alone and constructed simple tools...then constructed complex
    tools. Sraffa, I believe, errs suggesting "things were as they are"
    --- a common sin among Economists!
- Sraffa notes only at /r/ = /R/ the residue becomes all-important as
  the sole determinant of the price of the product.
  - Mathematically, this makes sense since /w/ = 0 when /r/ = /R/. Hence
    the infinite series sums infinitely many zeros.    
*** <<section_47>>47. Pattern of movement of individual terms with changes in distribution
- As the rate of profits rises, the value for each of the labor terms is
  pulled in the opposite direction by the rate of profits and by the
  wage...and it moves up or down as the one or the other prevails.
- The relative weight of these two factors varies at different levels of
  distribution. Besides, it varies differently in the case of terms of
  different "date", as we shall see.
- We have seen (\sect[[section_30][30]]) that --- if wage is expressed in terms of the
  Standard net product โ when the rate of profits /r/ changes, the wage /w/
  moves as
  \begin{equation}
  w = 1 - \frac{r}{R}
  \end{equation}
  where /R/ is the maximum rate of profits.
- Substituting this expression for the wage in each term in the
  reduction equation, the general form of any nth labor term becomes
  \begin{equation}
  L_{a_{n}}\left(1 - \frac{r}{R}\right) (1 + r)^{n}
  \end{equation}
  Consider the values (for this expression) as /r/ moves from 0 to its
  maximum /R/.
  - At /r/ = 0, the value for a labor term depends exclusively on its
    size regardless of date.
  - With a rise in the rate of profits, terms fall into two groups:
    1. those that correspond to labor done in more recent past (which
       begin at once to fall in value and fall steadily throughout);
    2. those representing labor more remote in time (which rise at
       first, then as each of them reaches its maximum value, turn and begin
       downward movement).
  - In the end, at /r/ = /R/, the wage vanishes and with it vanishes the
    value of each labor term.
  - This is best shown by a selection of curves, representing terms of
    widely different dates /n/ and different quantities of labor. Lets doodle
    this when /R/ is 25%. 
    
    [[./reductionTerms.png]]

    Variation in value of "Reduction terms" of different periods 
    $L_{n}w(1 + r)^{n}$ relative to the Standard commodity as the rate of
    profits varies between zero and /R/ (assumed to be 25%).

    The quantities of labor (/L_{n}/) in various "terms", which have been
    chosen so as to keep the curves within the page, are as follows: 
    /L_{0}/ = 1.04 (dashed black line); /L_{4}/ = 1 (orange line); 
    /L_{8}/ = .76 (red line); /L_{15}/ = .29 (green line); 
    /L_{25}/ = .0525 (blue line); /L_{50}/ = 0.0004 (solid black line).
- It is as if the rate of profits (when moving from 0 to /R/) generate a
  wave along the row of labor terms, the crest formed by successive
  terms, as one after another reach their maximum value.
  - At any value of the rate of profits, the term which reaches its
    maximum has the "date" 
    \begin{equation}
    n = \frac{1 + r}{R - r}
    \end{equation}
  - Conversely, the rate of profits at which any term of date /n/ is at
    its maximum when 
    \begin{equation}
    r = R - \frac{1 + R}{n + 1}
    \end{equation}
  - Accordingly, all terms for which $n\leq R^{-1}$ have their maximum
    at /r/ = 0 and thus form the group of "recent dates" mentioned above
    as falling in value for increasing /r/. 
*** <<section_48>>48. Movement of an aggregate of terms
- The labor terms may be regarded as the constituent elements of the
  price of a commodity, the combination of which may (with variation
  in the rate of profits) give rise to complicated patterns of
  price-movement, with several ups and downs.
- The simplest case, the "balanced commodity" (\sect[[section_21][21]]) or its equivalent,
  where the Standard commodity taken as an aggregate: its Reduction
  would result in a regular series, the quantity of labor for any term
  being (1 + /R/) times the quantity in the term immediately preceding it
  in date.
- Consider a complicated example: we suppose two products which differ
  in three of their labor terms, while being identical in all others.
  - One of them, /a/, has an excess of 20 units labor applied 8 years
    before, whereas the excess of the other, /b/, consists of 19 units
    employed in the current year and 1 unit bestowed 25 years prior.
  - (They are thus not unlike the familiar instances, respectively, of
    the wine aged in the cellars and of the old oak made into a chest.)
  - The difference between their Standard prices at various rates of
    profit, i.e. 
    \begin{equation}
    p_{a} - p_{b} = 20w (1+r)^{3}  - (19w + w(1+r)^{25})
    \end{equation}
    is represented in the following figure:
    [[./priceDiffs.png]]
- The price of "old wine" rises relative to the "oak chest" when the
  rate of profits move from 0 to 9%, then falls between 9% and 22% to
  rise again from 22% to 25%.
- (The reduction to dated labor has some bearing on the attempts to find
  in the "period of production" an independent measure of the quantity
  of capital which could be used --- without circular reasoning --- for
  determining prices and the shares in distribution.

  (But the case just considered seems conclusive showing the
  impossibility of aggregating the "periods" belonging to several
  quantity of labor into a single magnitude which could be regarded as
  representing the quantity of capital.

  (The reversals in direction of the movement of relative prices, in the
  face of unchanged methods of production, cannot be reconciled with *any*
  notion of capital as measurable quantity independent of distribution
  and prices.)
  - In this parenthetic remark, Sraffa just decimated the Neoclassical
    theory of production.
*** <<section_49>>49. Rate of fall of prices cannot exceed rate of fall of wages
- Something restricts the movement of any product's price: if (as a
  result of a rise in the rate of profits) the price falls, its rate of
  fall cannot exceed the rate of fall of the wage.
- So, if we draw two lines showing how the price for product /a/ and the
  wage (both expressed in terms of the Standard commodity) vary with the
  rise of the rate of profit, we see the price line cannot cut the wage
  line more than once...and even then, only in one direction: such that
  the price (from being lower) becomes higher than the wage with the
  rise of the rate of profits.
  [[./priceRestrict.png]]
- How to see this? We may look at the Reduction series or the original
  production equations for /a/. Sraffa considers the former.
  - The only variables (besides the price for /a/) are the wage and rate
    of profits, which rises with the fall of the wage...the combined effect of
    the two can never fall in the price more than in proportion to that of
    the wage. 
  - Sraffa next considers the production equation for commodity /a/. The
    prices for the means of production might upset the proposition if
    they were themselves capable of falling at a greater rate.
    
    But to see this is impossible, it is sufficient to turn our
    attention to the product whose rate of fall exceeds that of all
    others: this product (since it cannot have means of production
    capable of falling at a greater rate than it does) must itself fall
    less than wage.
- The conclusion is not affected if we take as measure of wages and
  prices any arbitrarily chosen product (instead of the Standard
  commodity), since what we are concerned with is the price-relation
  between labor and the given product...a relation which is *independent*
  of the medium adopted.
- It follows if wage is cut in terms of *any* commodity (no matter whether
  it is one that will rise or fall relative to the Standard commodity)
  the rate of profits will rise...and vice-versa for an increase of the
  wage.
- It also follows, if wage is cut in terms of one commodity, it is
  thereby cut in terms of all...and similarly for an increase. The
  direction of change is the same in relation to all commodities,
  however different may be the extent.
